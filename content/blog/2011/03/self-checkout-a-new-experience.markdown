Happy St. Patrick's day!

The wife and I decided to go to our local "super club" to look for a giant plastic tool shed for our backyard. So after taking care of all the fun stuff of the shed not having a price on it, then hunting down an employee to help, and finally after a fifteen minute wait at the customer service counter, we found out that the shed was much more than we expected. 

Anyway! I remembered I was in need of AA batteries.  I go through AAs like candy.  I use them for the spare xbox controller, wii controllers, piranha gun, and the million remote controls I have. I decided to grab a pack. I also noticed that they also had a new Self Checkout line. YAY!!!!

Ok, so we are at the super club so there are some new rules to self checkout.  Scan your card, scan your items, then pay. Easy right? No scale, bagging or anything!  Too good to be true right? Wrong!

There is an onsite self checkout "helper".  I was 3/4 of the way through my transaction and the helper came over and explained everything in detail.... absolute detail. They told me "Now when you're ready to pay, just press this 'Pay Now' button and then swipe your card."

My wife immediately caught on to how annoyed I was by this. She laughed all the way home.  It was a 30 minute drive home.... she just giggled again! 

I've been playing a good number of games. I have some good budget gaming posts on the way. Maybe some more tshirt posts. Trying to get the ball rolling again.
