Put your mouse arrow towards the middle of your screen and hold the windows key then press and hold the "+" key.  

Maximum zoomage!!!  

Use windows and "-" to zoom back out.  This is a really nice feature that was totally unknown to me. It's really great for web page cutout. The browser zoom feature is pretty lame and zooming in Vista was really glitchy. 

Anyway, I've been working on a bunch of jQuery plugins and trying to update some of my sites.  Should have some cool stuff to post soon.
