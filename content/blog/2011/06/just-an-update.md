As you may know, I'm a developer for [Rockfish Interactive](http://rockfishinteractive.com). Well, I'm a senior developer. I got promoted a few months ago.  Regardless, I code all day and I love it.  Why do I love it? I get to do different stuff all the time.  I get to do cut out, javascript, database work, and good ole C#.  It's never a dull moment, but can get a little stressful.  I'm currently on a project that has web, mobile web, and facebook components.  It's been a great opportunity to learn how to share content and site components across platforms.  I'm still trying to figure out the best way to share across mobile web and web. It still seems to be a case by case basis.  I ran into some frustrations on my current project. Main issues were multiple people on the same project. I have issues with source control. I dislike Mercurial, SVN, and all the other version controls I've used.  Need to try GIT I guess. 

Haven't had much time to blog lately. Heh, haven't had much time to do scouting, much gaming, or anything.  I'm going to make more of an effort when I come up with better ideas and make time.  Until then I'm just going to keep Minecrafting!
