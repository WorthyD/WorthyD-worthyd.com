Space is running out in our house. We're looking to clean out one of our bed rooms.  Amanda had her craft room and I had my office. I read an [article](http://www.elijahmanor.com/2011/01/transition-to-working-from-home.html) recently from [Elijah Manor](http://www.elijahmanor.com/), a developer I follow on twitter, about how he moved his office into his closet.  I got a little inspired.  I probably have A.D.D. and being in a smaller space would probably do me some good.

I moved into the closet and used a spare plank and some shelves I had for a desk.  This worked, but the desk was shaky and wasn't a comfortable height.

#### The Support Frame


The first step of my project was clear out the closet and setup a frame for the top of the desk to be placed on.  I'm paranoid when it comes to weight.  I cut three pieces of white pine. One for the back and two for the sides.  I screwed them into studs with two inch dry wall screws.   The sides didn't have two studs to sink into. I had to improvise a little with wall anchors. I cut two pieces for the corners for additional support. I have no idea if this actually helps, but I didn't think it could hurt.

#### The Desk Top


My next step was the desk top.  I needed a very odd sized piece of wood. My desired size was 28" deep and 59" wide.  I have a table saw to cut to fit, but I would have had to bought a piece of wood larger than what I could get home.  I wanted plywood, but it was a little unrealistic and I would have a lot of waste.  They came in 8' by 4' slabs or 5' by 3'.  Instead I bought a 14" by 72" and a 8" by 72" and joined them together with some cabinet hardware and wood glue.  I save about twenty dollars by doing this. Holes were drilled in the corners for cables. I sanded the heck out of them and sealed the wood with an aerosol sealant.

#### The Desktop Cover


I didn't want a wood style desk top.  I had seen several do it yourself shows where the hosts covered ply wood with a linoleum style cover.  I haven't been able to figure out what they use, but I did find something that I _thought_ would be acceptable.  I used [Con-Tact](http://www.idsgj.com/kittrich/index.asp) Creative Covering to cover my desk top.  I applied the covering like a giant vinyl sticker.  I experimented with a method to accommodate the drill holes, but it didn't work well.  After the covering was fully applied, I melted down the bubbles with matches and a candle lighter. Really wish I had a butane torch for this. I ended up melting the stuff a bunch of times because I couldn't control the flame well. Overall the result was acceptable, but I wish I had spent more time looking for a more heavy duty covering. I believe I purchased the lightweight version of the contact covering.

#### More Support and Cable Management


I used 90 degree corner braces to help spread out the weight and secure the top to the frame.  I spread out about eight of these through frame on the wall.  I purchased some large hooks to help with the power cables and found a bunch of smaller ones that I used for monitor cables.

#### The Final Result


I'm very satisfied with the final result. The total cost was around $50.  I run three monitors (currently a 20" wide, 19" and 17" square).  This can add up on pounds fast, but the desk doesn't flex much.  I had to run an extension cord to my power strip.  I had to verify that the cable could handle the amps for the powerstrip. I keep my tower on the floor on top of some scrap wood to help with ventilation.  It's a custom setup that puts out a lot of heat. I've been working out this setup for about two months now and I'm very happy with it.
