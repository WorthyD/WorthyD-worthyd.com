Nothing beats testing mobile sites on actual mobile devices, but it can be really annoying to have to frequently deploy to view every small change you make.  I haven't had great success with the Andoird and Black Berry emulators on my machine. You have to install a bunch of extra stuff and it is not straight forward. The iPhone emulator is great, but I don't develop on a Mac, don't easily have access to one and don't really want one. 

Here are a few apps/methods for initial mobile development, but I haven't tested any HTML5 capabilities with these (except Safari).



#### Safari


Totally ghetto, but this is normally what I use for testing javascript and inspecting the DOM.  The browser has a built in feature that lets you change the user agent.



#### [Opera Mobile](http://www.opera.com/developer/tools/)


This is my tool of choice for checking page layouts.  It is fairly lightweight and pretty customizable on resolutions and other fun stuff like that.



#### [iBBDemo2](http://code.google.com/p/ibbdemo2/)


This is an Adobe AIR app that acts as an iPhone and iPad emulator.  It is pretty nice, but I frequently find myself forgetting the commands to rotate the device and change the device from iPad to iPhone.



#### [Windows Phone 7 Emulator](http://create.msdn.com/en-US/)


Fairly useful. Takes a little while to load, but is fairly nice once it is up and running.



#### [Palm Pre Emulator](http://developer.palm.com/)


Runs on Virtual Box. It has been about a year since I used it though.
