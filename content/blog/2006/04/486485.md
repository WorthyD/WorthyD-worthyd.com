Nationals was a lot of fun. I'm totally worn out though. I'm going to start working out this next week on a regular basis. I heep saying I want to quit paintball, but every time I play a tournament I want to play more and more. I don't want to play because it costs too much and Amanda doesn't like me playing because I always hurt myself. We may have been offered a sponsorship with JT. This could turn the tides on cost completely. We'll see what happens. I've spent the day cleaning up equipment, napping, and playing Elder Scrolls.

We placed 8th at the tournament and pushed us up to 8th place overall for the season out of 62 teams.
