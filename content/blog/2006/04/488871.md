Amanda left this morning to go back to school. She comes home for good in less than three weeks. I'm really excited.

Every time she leaves I get really bummed out and start worrying about stuff. Mainly school. She makes me happy and I love her dearly

I get to go to the dermatologist tomorrow. I really hate being so moley. I should just pay a dr to tell me I'm ok and not going to die of cancer on a weekly basis.
