What I learned while I was in Dallas:

1\. Rich people in Dallas are A LOT nice than people who think they are rich in Arkansas.

2\. There are too many lanes on the road.

3\. You are not a welcomed member of the community if you do not own a Nascar shirt

4\. Gravy is a more acceptable condiment than ketchup

5\. The gravity of Dallas is stronger than anywhere else on earth... or i'm completely out of shape.

Nationals was a lot of fun. I'm totally worn out though. I'm going to start working out this next week on a regular basis. I heep saying I want to quit paintball, but every time I play a tournament I want to play more and more. I don't want to play because it costs too much and Amanda doesn't like me playing because I always hurt myself. We may have been offered a sponsorship with JT. This could turn the tides on cost completely. We'll see what happens. I've spent the day cleaning up equipment, napping, and playing Elder Scrolls.

We placed 8th at the tournament and pushed us up to 8th place overall for the season out of 62 teams.

Game Informer claims FF7 is being remade for PS3. I call BS.

Amanda left this morning to go back to school. She comes home for good in less than three weeks. I'm really excited.

Every time she leaves I get really bummed out and start worrying about stuff. Mainly school.

I get to go to the dermatologist tomorrow. I really hate being so moley. I should just pay a dr to tell me I'm ok and not going to die of cancer on a weekly basis.

50 hours into ElderScrolls Oblivion and it seems I'm just getting started :) I've completed the Thieves Guild and plan on finishing a bunch of other quests. We'll see how far I go before I start playing another game :)
