What I learned while I was in Dallas:

1\. Rich people in Dallas are A LOT nice than people who think they are rich in Arkansas.

2\. There are too many lanes on the road.

3\. You are not a welcomed member of the community if you do not own a Nascar shirt

4\. Gravy is a more acceptable condiment than ketchup

5\. The gravity of Dallas is stronger than anywhere else on earth... or i'm completely out of shape.
