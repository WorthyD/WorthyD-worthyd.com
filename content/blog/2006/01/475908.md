Three classes down. All seem well.

History from 1877 to present seems to be a breeze. Teacher said everyone should get at least a B

Discrete Mathematics may be a little difficult but I like math...even though math is evil and has a place in George Bush's Axis of Evil (Will Ferrell skit from SNL)

IT Infrastructure is with a teacher I've had before and only 11 people in the class. Should be easy.

Scheduled an appointment to get my car fixed.

Day has been good.
