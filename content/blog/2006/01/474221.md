**I START AT THE HAPRS IN HARBOR MEADOWS MONDAY**

I bought an old paintball gun of mine back today. Sold it for 200 bucks two years ago.... bought it for 50 and it came with extra equipment i could sell for 75 bucks so I could technically make some cash on this deal, but I'll pass on that.

Practice tomorrow.... I just really hope I can get to play some games.

I should graduate this December if I go to summer school.
