My console's backlight on my car has gone out. It's hard to drive home at night not knowing how fast you are going.

I was rather upset when I found out that John Williams didn't do the Goblet of Fire sound track. I probably wouldn't have bought it if I had known that.

**I START AT THE HAPRS IN HARBOR MEADOWS MONDAY**

I bought an old paintball gun of mine back today. Sold it for 200 bucks two years ago.... bought it for 50 and it came with extra equipment i could sell for 75 bucks so I could technically make some cash on this deal, but I'll pass on that.

Practice tomorrow.... I just really hope I can get to play some games.

I should graduate this December if I go to summer school.

The Lunar Ruins in FFIV aren't impressing me.

I'm to the Dawn Treader in the Chronicles of Narnia

I bought the first and second season set of Family Guy and I've been watching it constantly....

I've been doing, reading, and watching all of the above at the same time

So.... I got pulled over today... .for the first time ever....errmmmmm yeah... it sucked.... My tail lights are out.... I checked my manual and turns out they are on the fuse that's getting blown constantly.... soooooo... they've been out for a couple weeks now :) officer told me to drive with hazards on until they get fixed which will hopefully be this friday.

In other news I picked up a practically new ipod off a store kid for cheap... and he still has the 3 year protection plan on it.

Three classes down. All seem well.

History from 1877 to present seems to be a breeze. Teacher said everyone should get at least a B

Discrete Mathematics may be a little difficult but I like math...

IT Infrastructure is with a teacher I've had before and only 11 people in the class. Should be easy.

Scheduled an appointment to get my car fixed.

Day has been good.
