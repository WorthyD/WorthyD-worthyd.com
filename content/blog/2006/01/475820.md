So.... I got pulled over today... .for the first time ever....errmmmmm yeah... it sucked.... My tail lights are out.... I checked my manual and turns out they are on the fuse that's getting blown constantly.... soooooo... they've been out for a couple weeks now :) officer told me to drive with hazards on until they get fixed which will hopefully be this friday.

In other news I picked up a practically new ipod off a store kid for cheap... and he still has the 3 year protection plan on it.
