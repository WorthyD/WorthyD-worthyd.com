I never realized that my glasses sat so crooked on my face.... the frames fully hide one eye brow and leave the other one out in the wind..... guess that's what happens when you break your nose :-P Funny how it happened 4 years ago and I'm just now noticing it.

I get home.... try to play my FFVII game on my PSX and.... the memory card is empty.... Probably around 300 hours gone from Chrono Cross, FF 7 and 8 and several other misc games :(

Finals this week. Pressure is on high.

Amanda is all moved in. Hopefully life will be a lot less crazy with her closer.

Got my tuition bill in. Yeah... :-/
