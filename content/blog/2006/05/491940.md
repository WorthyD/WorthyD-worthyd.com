I get home.... try to play my FFVII game on my PSX and.... the memory card is empty.... Probably around 300 hours gone from Chrono Cross, FF 7 and 8 and several other misc games :(

Finals this week. Pressure is on high.

Amanda is all moved in. Hopefully life will be a lot less crazy with her closer.

Got my tuition bill in. Yeah... :-/

I think it's about time for another 100 useless facts about me.... maybe 200 since I've technically been inactive for six months.
