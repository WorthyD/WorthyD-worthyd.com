Soooooooooo.... I shipped Breath of Fire III to a buy on amazon two weeks ago. It's status on USPS shipping is still "Accepted in springdale". I've emailed the buyer several times asking if they received the package or if they haven't and want a refund.... I filed for lost mail today. Should I actually try to help or just leave it alone because the buyer isn't responding.

Also, ElderScrolls Oblivion is the greatest thing EVER!!!!!!!!!!!(so far)

It would be nice if my GPA was .16 higher so I could apply for internships at JB Hunt :(

So here is what I did over spring break:

Beat Zelda I(quest I) in 7 deaths (maybe 8 hours of play)
Beat Link the Past with 0 deaths in one day (i'm a whore with fairies in bottles) (also probably done in 8 hours of play)
Got to the Spirit Temple in Ocarina of Time (second to last dungeon) with 0 deaths (again i'm a whore with fairies in bottles) (at least 24 hours played. 12 non stop on sunday)

Got to the Hylia Lake dungeon in Majora's Mask(fourth dungeon out of six I think) in 15 deaths

Went to Batesville tuesday and spent the week with Amanda. It feels soooooooo great having two clickers on a mouse now (she has a mac laptop).

Best Spring Break EVER!!!! :)
