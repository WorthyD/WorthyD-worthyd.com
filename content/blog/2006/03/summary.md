_Life is like a mop. Sometimes life gets full of dirt and crud and hairballs and things and you gotta clean it out. You gotta stick it in here and rinse it off and start all over again. And sometimes life sticks to the floor so much that a mop, a mop, it's not good enough. You gotta get down there with like a toothbrush, you know, and you gotta really scrub 'cause you gotta get it off. But if that doesn't work, you can't give up. You gotta stand right up. You gotta run to a window and say, "These floors are dirty as hell, and I'm not gonna take it any more."_

\_The computer-animated Star Wars series is currently in pre-production, with scripts in development and animation tests underway. That show, which is to be set during the Clone Wars, should begin airing in the fall of 2007.

The second series, a live-action show, will be composed of one-hour episodes, with 100 hours of story initially charted. The story takes place after Revenge of the Sith but before A New Hope. No timeframe for production or airing has been officially mentioned yet.\_
From IGN.com

I really hope they don't mess this up.

Got to the Hylia Lake dungeon in Majora's Mask(fourth dungeon out of six I think) in 15 deaths

Went to Batesville tuesday and spent the week with Amanda. It feels soooooooo great having two clickers on a mouse now (she has a mac laptop).

Great Spring Break  :)

Starcraft: Ghost has been indefinitely postponed... i think that means they canceled it. After 4 years of work... yeah thanks.
