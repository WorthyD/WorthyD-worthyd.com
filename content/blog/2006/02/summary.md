## Some Crap of Mine For sale - 2006-02-13 03:47:58

PSX Games for sale because I know I'll never actually get around to playing them.

- Lunar: Silver Star Story (Bought for $70 at toys r us 4 or 5 years ago, make offer), Very good condition, edges of box kinda dinged up. Mini map is still sealed. I've played probably an hours worth of the game
- Lunar 2: Eternal Blue(Bought for $50 at Best Buy a day before Lunar, make offer), Uber Crazy Good condition, Never played and all the extras are sealed i think
- Arc The Lad Collection(got from EBGames new for $50 3 years ago, make offer), Mint, I think I opened the box once
- Suikoden 1, mint (want around $25)
- Threads of Fate, Mint (want around $20)
- Tales of Destiny(purchased for 30 used at Game X Change in highschool, make offer), decent condition, and there wasn't an instruction booklet.

I've never actually played through any of these games and all of them I purchased new with the exception of Tales of Destiny. I have a good idea what they are going for and I'm reasonable. If you live in NWA I'll works something out with you, but if I have to ship it off, you'll have to pay shipping. I'm seeing people try to sell both Lunar games for over $100 bucks on ebay. I'm not crazy and don't want that much for it.

Make offers, I'm willing to work with people. If I don't sell or have offers I'm going to throw them on EBay or take them to Game Stop and put towards Kingdom Hearts II

I'm thinking about selling my SNES stuff too.
