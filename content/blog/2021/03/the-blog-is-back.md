I've missed blogging and sharing my knowledge/opinions for a while. I've looked into several different self hosted solution and I decided to create a Gatsby site. I'd like to learn a little more React and GraphQL.  

I've dug through and converted all of my old blog posts from my old tech blog and geek blog posts.  Most are decently in tact, but I'm going to need to dig up old images.  

I've also found over 2000 of my old Live Journal posts. I'm going to curate and republish a lot of them.  It'll be cringe worthy material, but that's just who I am.  

I plan on posting up woodworking projects, tech stuff, and game stuff.

Stick around and enjoy the nonsense.
