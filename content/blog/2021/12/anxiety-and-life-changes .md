Lots fo life changes and stuff hit all at once over the last month.  My mother in law is in declining health and had to move in with us.  She has to use a walker and has normal days and very low days.  Our house isn't very handicap accessible.  It's a 2 story house, master bedroom and office downstairs, kids and guest bedrooms upstairs. 

This resulted in me converting my office into a bedroom.  I'm not bent out of shape over this.  It needed to happen.  I moved my work laptop and a couple monitors upstairs to the guest bedroom and our gaming consoles to the master bedroom. 

I really didn't know what to do with my gaming PC. I don't have ethernet in the guest bedroom and it's far enough away that the wifi signal is rubbish.  I ended up putting my pc in the bedroom and hooking up a small monitor to it to play games. It's not at a desk and I use a wireless keyboard with a touchpad on it. I really prefer to use mouse and keyboard for playing games.  I now sit on the floor in my bed room and hope the flashing screen doesn't wake my wife up. She's a light sleeper 

Roughly two days into the new situation I started having super high levels of anxiety. I thought I was going to need to go to the hospital.  Everything seemed to be a trigger. Thinking about Destiny 2 or my unfinished woodworking projects were some of the worst.  I find a lot of joy playing games and working with my hands, but recent events turned them into my biggest stressors.

I normally can rely on playing Destiny 2 for some relief, but I no longer have the same experience. I have an almost ritualistic method when it comes to Destiny 2 and it sounds so silly in my head considering how lavish it is compared to how most other people play the game.

It wasn't just not having my setup that was hard, it was the anxiety of knowing there was stuff to be done in game.  Triumphs and quests are eventually going away and not working on them bothered me.  I  working on my in-game checklist takes my mind off things and gives me a sense of accomplishment.
