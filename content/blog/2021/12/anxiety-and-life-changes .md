## The Long Backstory

Lots fo life changes and stuff hit all at once over the last month.  My mother in law is in declining health and had to move in with us.  She has to use a walker and has normal days and very low days.  Our house isn't very handicap accessible.  It's a 2 story house, master bedroom and office downstairs, kids and guest bedrooms upstairs. 

This resulted in me converting my office into a bedroom.  I'm not bent out of shape over this.  It needed to happen.  I moved my work laptop and a couple monitors upstairs to the guest bedroom and our gaming consoles to the master bedroom. 

I really didn't know what to do with my gaming PC. I don't have ethernet in the guest bedroom and it's far enough away that the wifi signal is rubbish.  I ended up putting my pc in the bedroom and hooking up a small monitor to it to play games. It's not at a desk and I use a wireless keyboard with a touchpad on it. I really prefer to use mouse and keyboard for playing games.  I now sit on the floor in my bed room and hope the flashing screen doesn't wake my wife up. She's a light sleeper. Hunter's sleeping habits have also shifted. He gets up around 5 now and this cuts my normal morning gaming time by half.

Roughly two days into the new situation I started having super high levels of anxiety. I thought I was going to need to go to the hospital.  Everything seemed to be a trigger. Thinking about Destiny 2 or my unfinished woodworking projects were some of the worst.  I find a lot of joy playing games and working with my hands, but recent events turned them into my biggest stressors.

I normally can rely on playing Destiny 2 for some relief, but I no longer have the same experience. I have an almost ritualistic method when it comes to Destiny 2 and it sounds so silly in my head considering how lavish it is compared to how most other people play the game.

It wasn't just not having my setup that was hard, it was the anxiety of knowing there was stuff to be done in game.  Triumphs and quests are eventually going away and not working on them bothered me.  I working on my in-game checklist takes my mind off things and gives me a sense of accomplishment.

I was amazed at how long it took me to convince myself that it was Ok not to play Destiny.  I'm not addicted to Destiny. I've never sacrificed family or work to play. It's just one of my favorite hobbies.

My wife also started working from home. This makes my typical work day a little more complicated. Does a good husband inhale lunch and spent the last 55 minutes of his lunch hour in the garage?

That's a long way of saying that I needed to convince myself that my old stress relief methods needed to be replaced.  I couldn't game the way I normally would and I couldn't work on wood the way I normally wood.

## Journey to Ok

It took me several days to get into the head space and identify my stressors.  I was angry that my mother in law had to move in with us. The situation could have been prevented. It's complicated, political and could burn bridges if I shared my perspective.  Keeping up with Destiny was giving me anxiety. I have some organization wood working projects I wanted to do. Not being able to do them was causing me stress.

I had to convince myself that a 5th person living with us is the new reality.  Maybe if we can get her better health care, we can get her somewhere that can take better care of her. $3k a month for assisted living is way too much to split between our family and my wife's brother.  We ran the numbers and can't realistically do it. Anything we could do right now would only get her a couple of months of care and toss our planned long term investments out the window.  There isn't anything my wife and I can do to long term impact this stressor so we are doing our best to adapt to it.  

Gaming was the next thing I needed to address.  I normally play from 4am to 6am. I haven't really done any evening gaming since the kids started Taekwondo.
