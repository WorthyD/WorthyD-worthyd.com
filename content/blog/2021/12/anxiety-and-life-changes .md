Lots fo life changes and stuff hit all at once over the last month.  My mother in law is in declining health and had to move in with us.  She has to use a walker and has normal days and very low days.  Our house isn't very handicap accessible.  It's a 2 story house, master bedroom and office downstairs, kids and guest bedrooms upstairs. 

This resulted in me converting my office into a bedroom.  I'm not bent out of shape over this.  It needed to happen.  I moved my work laptop and a couple monitors upstairs to the guest bedroom and our gaming consoles to the master bedroom. 

I really didn't know what to do with my gaming PC. I don't have ethernet in the guest bedroom and it's far enough away that the wifi signal is rubbish.  I ended up putting my pc in the bedroom and hooking up a small monitor to it to play games. It's not at a desk and I use a wireless keyboard with a touchpad on it. I really prefer to use mouse and keyboard for playing games.
