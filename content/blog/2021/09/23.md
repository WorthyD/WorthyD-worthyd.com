Took roughly a week off of Destiny.  Partially out of situation.  Kids haven't been staying in their beds in the morning and it's been a battle.  Got through the weekly Shattered Realm and accidentally clipped out of bounds grabbing an ascendent shard.  Wasn't able to get back in bounds to complete the activity. Kind of a bummer, but I'll finish it off tomorrow.

I've been playing the FF1 Pixel Remaster after the kids go to bed. I finished Mt. Gulg and unlocked the Fire Crystal last night. I've been really happy with the game so far. I feel like the difficulty has been scaled down quite a bit.  It's made a good casual play through.

I'm going through old Livejournal posts and importing them here. Some older stuff is super cringe worthy. I'm updating spelling and removing names.  I have about 2000 posts and I don't expect more than a 1/4 of them make it here. I blogged a lot about my gaming stuff.  We'll see how it pans out.
