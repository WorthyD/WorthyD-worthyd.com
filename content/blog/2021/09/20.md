Amanda left today to go to a church conference for the week.  Solo parenting for the week.  We rarely get time away from each other like this.  It's going to be a challenging week, but we'll survive.

Pfizer vaccine is getting submitted to the FDA for 5-11 year olds.  I'm really excited about this.  I'm ready for the kids to get vaccinated.  I saw the news on my youtube feed.  I watched one of the videos breaking the news and was kind of surprised by the number of dislikes on the video and the mass number of negative comments.  I try hard to understand other point of views, but the anti-vaxx movement just blows my mind.  Microchipping has nothing on some of the nonsense being said.  

Getting the kids to bed right now. Hoping to try to finish implementing web workers on my destiny dashboard app and then spend some time playing the pixel remaster of Final Fantasy.
