I finished the audio book for [Atomic Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299) today. Really good read and I plan to employ some of the stuff it mentions. One of them will be journaling daily.  I may not publish daily, but I hope to get stuff out there more often.

One of the big call outs was to have a dedicated space to where you work, if you work from home.  I put a lot of effort into my workspace. Couple of button presses and I can go from working to personal PC.  Supposedly, it's not good for your 'flow', but I _think_ I'm disciplined enough to handle it.
