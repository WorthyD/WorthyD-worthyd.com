I've decided that I'm going to work my way off my anti-anxiety/anti-depressant medication.  I've been on varying drugs since 2010 and I want to give it an honest try.

I rearranged my desk at home again.  I've never found a good configuration of my mic on my desk.  I finally found the original Blue Yeti stand for my  mic and I'm just going to use that for now.  I swapped my left and right monitors.  I want to eventually change my left monitor to vertical again. 

I haven't had Discord on for the last week.  I was super close to my Destiny group in Discord, but it became too big of a daily distraction.  I can definitely say I'm more focused while it's not running, but I now have almost no desire to play Destiny.

Amanda is home in 2 days. Solo parenting has been going well this week.
