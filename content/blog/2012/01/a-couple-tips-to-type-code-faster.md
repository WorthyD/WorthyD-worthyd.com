I'm not too embarrassed to say it, but I was looking at my fingers when I was typing until I was a senior in highschool.   I was sneaky with the keyboarding teacher.  Over the past year or so, I've really been trying hard to learn to type faster and more efficiently.

  1. #### Don't look at your fingers..... ever

This goes without saying.



  2. #### Use the number keys not on the number pad.

I still have a hard time with this, but I have noticed a speed improvement.  My suggestion is to force yourself to not use the number pad or get a keyboard like [this](http://store.apple.com/us/product/MC184LL/B?fnode=MTY1NDA1Mg).  My keyboarding teacher told us it was Ok to look at your fingers when looking at hitting numbers.  It can be difficult, but very worth it.





  3. #### Use a snippet manager




Find an acceptable snippet manager for your IDE.  I've been using [Snip Mate](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2540) for vim and [Snippet Designer](http://snippetdesigner.codeplex.com/) for Visual Studio.  VS has some nice snippets, but they are hard to manage.

#### Use VIM!!!!




I'm a big fan of VIM.  VIM prevents you from EVER having to use the mouse or arrow keys.  I'm still not an expert on it, but I don't see how someone could be an expert. There is a ton of stuff to learn.  I've been watching [Derek Wyatt's videos](http://derekwyatt.org/vim/tutorials/index.html) and they have helped out A LOT.  I generally use [VSVim](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329) for my Visual Studio.  It's not perfect, but it's pretty darn close.    





  5. #### Try a different keyboard layout




This is pretty drastic, but drastic measures can yield awesome results.  Try [Dvorak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard). Qwerty was designed for typewriters to help prevent jams. Essentially, Dvorak keeps your fingers on the home row 70ish percent of the time. You can read a good article about why Dvorak is faster [here.](http://www.howtogeek.com/trivia/which-keyboard-layout-is-faster-than-the-standard-qwerty-configuration/)
