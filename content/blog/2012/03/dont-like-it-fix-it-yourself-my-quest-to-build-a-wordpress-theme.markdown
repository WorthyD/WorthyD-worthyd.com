I got pretty upset with my last wordpress theme.  The theme was stripping out all of my script tags I was inserting and replacing them with comment tags.  I'm attempting to add ads to my theme, track with Google Analytic, and other things.  I tried going to their support forums, but you have to pay now to view them.  Again, pretty frustrating.  

I fix this, I'm going to build my own Wordpress theme.  Going to start with the default Twenty Eleven theme and build it out the way I want it. I may even build out some of my own plugins. I'm going to have fun with this!
