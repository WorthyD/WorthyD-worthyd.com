Co-Worker: Hey Daniel! Can you check this site out on the company iPad!?!?!
Me: Yeah sure what's the URL?
Co-Worker: http://www.superlogurlwithextracharacters.us?queryvar=1&var;=abvceor&mobiledetectioin;=42&key;=wholikestacos
Me: Ummm..... *sad face*

I work with a lot of mobile devices at work and I'm not comfortable setting up my email on company devices. It hit me like a ton of bricks. USE QR TECHNOLOGY!!!!!!

I go to [http://qrcode.kaywa.com/](http://qrcode.kaywa.com/) or any other qr generator.  Download a QR app on your device that can open URLs in the native browser.  I use [SimpleAct Inc. Best Barcode Scanner](http://itunes.apple.com/bb/app/best-barcode-scanner-scan/id454087075?mt=8). It works on all iDevices and it works great.  Pull up the QR on your screen, point your camera to it, and BAM!!!! Site pulls upon your device.

I haven't gotten around to finding any QR apps on Android and Windows Phone 7 yet.

This has shaved countless minutes of typing out complex urls on a tiny device.
