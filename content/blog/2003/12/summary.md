I'm so tired.... We had 14 teams that played the tournament. Round robin if i calculated right thats over 80 games. Maybe.... but still I had to start every game and my wistle got so filled with dirt it wouldn't work anymore so I had to yell "Listen for the ten seconds in three two one ten seconds! _Ten seconds pass_ GOOOOOO!!!" at the top of my lungs about 60 times. It hurts to talk. I'm really tired too. I"m gonig to bed....

Status of my first game of SoM
18 hours lvl 40 just got past the town of Ishe

Current status of my new game
8 hours lvl 42 Just got to Jadd

Now Jadd and Ishe are pretty far apart from each other. I'd say 3 or 4 hours if I don't level up.

Well this morning I met my match in SoM. I killed 999 Rabillions. The pink version of the rabites. After you kill that many they become Dark Rabillions. After killing that many of any enemy it becomes dark and is really really strong. For the Rabillion its hp goes from 73 to 500 something. Its defense and attack go up 100 points. From 16 to 116 is a pretty big jump now. My strongest weapons and magic do one damage to these suckers. One other odd thing I'd like to mention is that the babies drop Glittering armor for a side quest you're supose to do. A FAQ claims there is a 10% chance of them droping the stuff. I only got two out of 999. 10% my butt. However one very good thing I like about them is that since they are so strong my magic and weapons will level up like CRAZY when I fight them. Well I think I may go on my lunch break now.........

Well I'm working on the glittering helm side quest on SOM. Again 10% chance of getting one from a cocatrice. HOw many have i killed? about 300! And the worst part is that there is only one in a battle screen. I can't find anywhere that has two. So i must enter and leave the same screen constantly. All my magic and weapons are leveled up high enough to the point i can defeat most any enemy with one hit. I'm twice the level that I was the first time around at the level. I beat Medusa with three hits of my sword! The scarey part is that my sword is my weakest weapon. ALl my other weapons are made out of Mythril. My Sword is made out of some alloy that starts with an A. Its two or three levels down from Mythril. I hope everything goes well tonight.
