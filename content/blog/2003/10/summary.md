Today was kinda weird. In my philosophy class a student asked the teacher if she believed in God or not. The class was dead silent. She said she changed her mind all the time. After class I went to the grocery store on the way to B&E; Paintball to hang out with my buddy Ed!

I went to work and worked for a while. Ben, my boss at the paintball field called me and told me about the Orracle he ordered for me. Its costing me $550!!! Its normally a $1000 gun! I was so excited. I'm waiting for the Joe Schmo show on Spike TV to show. Its a really funny show.

## Gone  - datePublished: 2003-10-29



I've officially retired from large Web Forums. I'm staying on my companies web forums and Demon Penguin forums. I've been at RPGamer for a year. I only have one friend left that was there when I joined. Most of the people in between have disappeared because they quit the boards, switched screen names, and random other stuff. I'm just sick of it. I'm just making friends I most likely will never meet. It sucks really freakin bad. I've discussed everything I've wanted to discuss so whats the point? I don't think many people noticed me anyway. Several times I left and came back without anyone noticing. Besides the admins seemed like jerks. I doubt they were really jerks. Just doing their job, but pushing the limit. Lets see if i can actually hold true to my word and not return.
