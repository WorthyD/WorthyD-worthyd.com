I've officially retired from large Web Forums. I'm staying on my companies web forums and Demon Penguin forums. I've been at RPGamer for a year. I only have one friend left that was there when I joined. Most of the people in between have disappeared because they quit the boards, switched screen names, and random other stuff. I'm just sick of it. I'm just making friends I most likely will never meet. It sucks really freakin bad. I've discussed everything I've wanted to discuss so whats the point? I don't think many people noticed me anyway. Several times I left and came back without anyone noticing. Besides the admins seemed like jerks. I doubt they were really jerks. Just doing their job, but pushing the limit. Lets see if i can actually hold true to my word and not return.
