Ahhhh Pulled an 11 hour work day today! It was fun. Dirt isn't doing well at Cup, they didn't make the semi finals. The all stars took the last spot going into the finals. The prelim schedule looks pretty messed up. All the good pro teams didn't make it into the top 5 spots. Its VERY messed up. Oh well. I think I'm going to hit the sack here in a few.

My dad had a heart attack early early this morning. He's going to be fine but I'm still scared.

Dad's doing alright. He should be home tomorrow. I wasn't scared. I didn't cry. It was odd. I'm excited he's ok.

Well today was productive. I shot Bill. The third time in two years. Bill's basically my idol. My super hero in the paintball world. I feel good when he shots me, and even better when i shoot him. He's got 13 years experience over me. I've worked hard for him and he respects me. I love Bill.

Well my day was horrible. My cousin died today. She had breast cancer and the chemo therapy cause a flesh eating infection. The doctors removed her intestine and colon, and her heart gave out. Its not fair. She had a three year old daughter. Mom and I had to listen to her grandma explain why her mom isn't coming back. It was so sad. I'm happy that she isn't suffering anymore, but its just not fair for her daughter.
