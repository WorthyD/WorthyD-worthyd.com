[David Walsh](http://davidwalsh.name/) has a great series he does called [Confessions of a Web Developer.](http://davidwalsh.name/confessions-xiv)  I've been reading them since about part 6 or 7 and I enjoy every one of them.  I have been struggling with content here for a long time and he had some great tweets over the past few days that motivated me to put more effort into this blog.  I'm really great at complaining so I figured I'd follow the master.  As always, opinions are my own.





  * **I haven't felt challenged in my work for a long time.**  Thankfully, I'm in the position that I can inject challenge into my work.  I try new design patterns, frameworks and testing strategies.


	
  * I've put a lot of effort into my Youtube channel, but **it takes way too much time and dedication to run it well**.  I've kinda given up on it.  Gathering resources and preparing a tutorial for a 10 to 20 minute video takes me about 20 hours of stop and go work.


	
  * I'm a hypocrite when it comes to commit messages.  I tell everyone to keep them descriptive, but the **last 50 commit messages to my personal repo is "stuff".**


	
  * I look over a lot of resumes at work.  I pay more attention to where you have worked and how long you have worked there.  I value loyalty more than skill.  **A developer with 2 - 5 year employments is more valuable to me than someone with 10 - 1 year employments.**  Constant jumps tell me  you are more interested in promotions than improving your skills.

	

  * I can't show off the vast majority of the projects I've worked on due to NDAs.  I've been apart of developing and launching around 75 products. **I've worked on around 125 if you include projects I've done maintenance or consulted on** in the last 7 years.  I can maybe talk about 15 of them.  I feel like this puts me at a disadvantage in the job market, but I'm not looking for a job so it's not an big deal.

	
  * **I want to tell people that bash IE to just "Shut the hell up".**  It's beating the dead horse with his own fossilized bones.  We all know IE 6, 7, and 8 are challenging to develop for. I think most of these people are too high on their Mac horse to look and see how much effort Microsoft has put in the newer versions of the browsers.

	
  * You're dead to me if you hate on Win 8 without a good reason. **The start screen change is not an acceptable answer.**

	
  * To this day, I do not understand why open source developers hate on .Net developers.  I've even seen **".Net snobs need not apply"** on a Ruby On Rails job posting.  It feels really immature. 

	
  * **I'm in a constant battle of whether I want to dress professionally or like a geek.**  I have a large collection of shirts, but I was known as "tshirt guy" for a long time.  I really want to be respected, but it's challenging wearing a Zelda & Dr Who crossover shirt.

	
  * **I don't think you deserve the help if you didn't spend 15 minutes trying to find the answer on Google**.  You need to put some effort into it before asking someone to stop what they are doing to help you.

	
  * **I value being an Eagle Scout more than being a college graduate.**  I didn't take away a lot from college, but it did provide me a reference that landed me my job. 

	
  * I only allow recruiters on LinkedIn to contact me **so that I can tell them no**.  It's an ego thing.

	
  * I've haven't found responsive web design challenging or interesting in several years.  I'm sure some people would say "You're not doing it right".  I've looked at a lot of sites, gone through source code from frameworks, and read many articles.  **I'm confident in my skills and capabilities.**

        
  * I judge you based on whether you use a **GUI or command line** for tasks.
