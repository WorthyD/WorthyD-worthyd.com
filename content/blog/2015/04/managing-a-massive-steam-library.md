I have a massive Steam library.  I'm not rich or anything, but I purchase a lot of [Humble Bundles](https://www.humblebundle.com/) and I'm a sucker for 50 cent games on sale.  I've acquired over 300 games/DLCs and it's really challenging to keep everything organized in steam categories.  I spent a long time with two windows open trying to categorize based on tags, genre and rating.  I recently went through and setup all controller supported into it's own category. I switched computers and Steam's cloud system overwrote it.  I eventually gave up and just let things go wild in my library.

Happiness returned when I stumbled upon [Depressurizer!](https://github.com/rallion/depressurizer)  Depressurizer provides you an interface for managing your Steam categories very quickly.  I was able to auto-categorize  based on User Tags, Genre, Store Flags, Ratings and a ton of other fields.  Depressurizer will write to your Steam directory, but also export it to a physical file in case Steam forgets all your hard work.  I've stored my app in my Dropbox folder so I can work on my library on my Surface and my main setup.

This app is a must if you have more than 50 games in your Steam library.  Plus, it's an open source .net project!  I may just contribute to it in the future :)
