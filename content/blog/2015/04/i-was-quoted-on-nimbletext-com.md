A former colleague of mine send me a message on Facebook a couple of days ago.  He had told me I was on the front page of [http://nimbletext.com/](http://nimbletext.com/).  If you do anything with SQL statements or arrays, you should check the tool out.  It's incredibly useful.

What's really cool?  [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com) was quoted just a few paragraphs about me.  I found NimbleText from his list of [Ultimate Developer Tools](http://www.hanselman.com/tools).

Yeah, it's kinda silly I'm freaking out like this, but Scott's one of my development heroes.
