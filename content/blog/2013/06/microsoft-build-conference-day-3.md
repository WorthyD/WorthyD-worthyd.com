I drug around most of today.  We had a lot of information in a really short amount of time.  Here's a quick overview of my sessions for the day.



### [Developing High Performance Websites and Modern Apps with JavaScript Performance Tools](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013/3-316)

This was a pretty fun session about how to use the new F12 profiling tools.



### [Visual Studio 2013 for Web Developers: Deep Dive](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013/3-503)

This session was packed.  I had to watch it from an overflow room and barely got a seat in there.  Mads Kristensen went over some of the really cool features that are now pulled out of web essentials and plugged directly into VS 2013.  He also published the VS 2013 Web Essentials Preview AND published the GitHub project for it.



### [Reusing Your Web Development Skills in Windows Store Apps](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013/3-503)

This session was good, but I found it a little misleading. It was mainly how to use what jQuery you already know properly in Win 8 HTML apps. 

I didn't make it to our last session. I decided to spend some time in the Sponsor area. It was pretty empty so I spend a good amout of time talking with people from [Xarmin](http://xamarin.com/), Nokia, [Parse](https://www.parse.com/) and some people with Azure.

[Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/) and [Damian Edwards](http://damianedwards.wordpress.com/) were hanging out at the Azure booth.  I really love the fact that most of the speakers hang out and socialize with the other devs throughout the conference.  Both these guys decided to try to chain 128 USB hubs, that were being given away by Azure, to power a mouse.  They got all of them together, all the lights came on, but power for the mouse only got to about the 5th hub.  It was pretty funny and it drew in a really big crowd.

The conference was essentially over at 3. We decided to head over to Fisherman's Wharf and do a little sight seeing.  We saw Alcatraz and a little bit of the Golden Gate Bridge. Fog prevented the bridge from being seen, but I can now say I've seen the bridge and the main setting from The Rock and Escape from Alcatraz. 

It's been a really fun trip, but I'm ready to be home with my girls.  I'm getting up at 3:30 tomorrow morning to catch my flight.  Here is to safe travels!
