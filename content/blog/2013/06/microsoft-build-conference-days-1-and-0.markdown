Microsoft [Build](http://buildwindows.com) doesn't officially kick off tomorrow, but I'm going to go ahead and fill you in on my trip so far.

Day -1

I'm not the biggest fan of traveling. I've always relied heavily on my wife to get me where to go in airports and while driving.  I've been pretty nervous the past few days. This is going to be the longest I've been away from Amanda since we got married almost 6 years ago and it is definitely the longest I've been away from my 14 month old daughter Lily.

To make this extended time apart as easy as possible, we spent the whole day together in Tulsa. We went to the Zoo, the mall, Baby's R Us and just enjoyed each other's company.  I really needed it and I wasn't interrupted a whole lot by work.

Day 0

Amanda and Lily dropped me off at the Tulsa airport where I flew to Huston then to San Fran.  Tulsa to Huston was awesome.  It was one of those 3 seats per row and I got the seat by the window all by myself.  I worked on a power point presentation on code branching strategies. 

From Huston to San Fran was a different story.  Exit row with no seat in front... in the middle of 2 guys who liked the elbow rest.  Not fun, but it could have been worse.  I started reading [American Sniper](http://www.amazon.com/American-Sniper-Autobiography-Military-History/dp/0062238868/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1372224907&sr=8-1&keywords=american+sniper) and napped.

Getting to the hotel was fun too. I got lost and got a real culture shock.  You're not really use to the kind of stuff you see in San Francisco in North West Arkansas. I met up with the other guy from Rockfish who is attending the conference and we've setup our battle stations in the hotel room. I was really hoping to get to play the new Borderlands 2 DLC that came out today, but the internet connection is pretty slow. It's been downloading for four hours now and it's only a gig.

Tomorrow starts off the big day.  I'll do my best to post frequent updates on my twitter account [@WorthyD](https://twitter.com/worthyd).
