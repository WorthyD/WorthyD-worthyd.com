Busy, but awesome day in tech at Build.  Going to be short but sweet.


### [Keynote](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013/1-002)

Lots of good stuff shown off for VS2013, Azure and Office 365.



### [Whatâ€™s New in ASP.NET and Visual Studio 2013](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013/2-546)

I wont lie. [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/) is one of the reason I love coming to dev conferences. I find him extremely inspirational and he does such a great job at making his sessions fun. I've watched a lot of his sessions twice.  
Scott dove into all the great new features coming to VS 2013. Showed off how asp.net is moving to "one" asp.net with seamless integration between MVC and .net forms. Developers will be empowered to build their own templates a lot easier.
This was the session of the event for me.  Due to some long demos, these sessions were shifted back a little bit. Scott entertained us with Ascii street view, http://letmebingthatforyou.com/, youtube videos and tons of other fun stuff.  He actually favorited my tweet.

This was absolute nervana for me.  My coworker and I saw him in the dev area. We wanted to go talk to him but we both felt like we would be this Chris Farley character.  
I really didn't feel up to embarrassing myself like that.  Go watch his session, even if you don't code. You'll get a good laugh.



### [Scaling the Real-time Web with ASP.NET SignalR](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013/3-502)

This was a very informative session that answered just about all of my questions about scaling SignalR. Damian did a really great job demoing all the scaling tools.



### [Fast Apps and Sites with JavaScript](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013/4-313)

This was a great session. It put me in my place that I'm not nearly as good at javascript as I thought I was.  I normally focus on maintainability and best practices in code. This session was kinda like, to heck with all that! Lets make everything run SUPER FAST! It was pretty mind blowing for me.



### [Create Fast and Fluid Interfaces with HTML and JavaScript](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013/3-156)

This was an extension of the what's new for WinJS from yesterday.  Paul went over a lot of the new features, why they decided to improve them and went over code for them. 

Today was full of tons of great info.  I'm really ready to be home though.  I miss my family a great deal. I hid in a corner and tried to face time with Amanda and Lily.  The wifi wasn't so great and it ended shortly.  I found several other people doing the same thing a couple hours later. It was good to know I wasn't the only one missing my family.
