I return to school after a week full of work. I'm not excited to be here one bit. I'm tired of the stereotypical frat/sorority entities that frequent campus. I bet my presence annoys them just as much as they do me. I have 4 hours of classes left and I'm done here. Five full years here and I really doubt I will miss it one bit. This is my last semester of class, of paintball, and of torment.

The university team went down to Dover, AR this past weekend. We used the alias name Vile Red Falcon since it wasn't a sanctioned college tournament. We placed second to some guys from Little Rock. Three years ago when the U of A team would clash with JL every weekend and actually do well. I'm not sure what has killed my motivation. The crappy fields around here, the irritating local players, or I'm just getting burned out. I feel I could quit now and never have any regrets. We were 8th in the nation last season and we didn't even try.
