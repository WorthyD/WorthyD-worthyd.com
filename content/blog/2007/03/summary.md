## Woe of Spring Break - 2007-03-27 15:30:05

I return to school after a week full of work. I have 4 hours of classes left and I'm done here. Five full years here and I really doubt I will miss it. This is my last semester.

The university team went down to Dover, AR this past weekend. We used the alias name Vile Red Falcon since it wasn't a sanctioned college tournament. We placed second to some guys from Little Rock. Three years ago when the U of A team would clash with JL every weekend and actually do well. I'm not sure what has killed my motivation. The crappy fields around here, the irritating local players, or I'm just getting burned out. We were 8th in the nation last season and we didn't even try.
