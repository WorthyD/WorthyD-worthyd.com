jQuerypad allows you to quickly develop javascript/jQuery code without a bunch of database calls or heavy CSS slowing down page load. It's a great tool for experimenting or optimizing code. 

It doesn't require an install. Simply unzip the file, plug in your HTML markup and start coding away.  Your code is written to a file so you can easily export it or view it later.
