Over the last year or so I've been looking for quick and easy ways to become more productive while coding. After using [WinSplit](http://worthyd.com/techblog/index.php/2010/07/winsplit/) for a little bit, I learned that keyboard shortcuts are great way to quickly increase productivity.

I've compiled a list of shortcuts for the following programs: Visual Studio, Firefox, Outlook, and Windows 7

## Visual Studio

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ctrl + k, Ctrl + d | Format Document | Great for quickly re-indenting HTML or XML |
| Ctrl + k, ctrl + c | Comment Block of Text | Works on everything except CSS |
| Ctrl + k, ctrl + u | Uncomment Block of Text | Same as above |
| Ctrl + Alt + L | Moves cursor to solution explorere | This can be really useful depending on how you have your directories set up. |
| Ctrl + Shift + b | Builds Solution |     |
| Ctrl + W | Window.CloseCurrentDocumentWindow | Normally Ctrl + F4, but I remapped mine to be more like Firefox |
| Ctrl + tab or ctrl + shift + tab | Navigate between tabs |     |

## Firefox

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ctrl + t | Open New Tab |     |
| Ctrl + w | Close current Tab |     |
| Ctrl + k | Set cursor to Search Box | After doing this you can use Ctrl + Up or down to navigate through the different search types. |
| Ctrl + l | Set cursor to address bar |     |
| Ctrl + d | Bookmark Current Page |     |
| Ctrl + f | Find |     |
| Ctrl + tab or ctrl + shift + tab | Navigate between tabs |     |

## Outlook

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ctrl + n | New Message |     |
| Ctrl + r | Reply |     |
| Ctrl + shift + r | Reply to All |     |
| Ctrl + f | Forward |     |
| Ctrl + i | Navigate to Inbox |     |
| Ctrl + shift + tab | Navigate to the left menu |     |

## Windows 7

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows + Arrow Keys | Move Window | Kinda cool if you don't have Winsplit. Windows 7 only. |
| Ctrl + w | Close current explorer window |     |
