[![box](http://blog.worthyd.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/bridges-boxleitner-150x150.jpg)](http://blog.worthyd.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/bridges-boxleitner.jpg)I have to admit, this is probably the most clever shirt I own.  Obviously it's a fun copy of the [Harley Davidson Logo](http://blog.worthyd.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Harley-Davidson.jpeg).  Lets face it. I'm probably the last person you'd ever see wearing H.D. apparel and look tough. I'd totally rock a light cycle though.

I picked this shirt up from [alt](http://thinkgeek.com/) in a $6 random t-shirt grab bag from [ThinkGeek.com](http://thinkgeek.com) along with [Scrap Metal](http://worthyd.com/geekblog/index.php/2010/07/geek-shirt-thursday-think-geek-r2d2-scrap-metal/).    I immediately knew it was a TRON based shirt. I will admit, I never saw TRON until recently. I've always wanted to watch it after I saw it was included in [Kingdom Hearts II](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009A4EVM?ie=UTF8&tag=woteblgebl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0009A4EVM)![afd](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=woteblgebl-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0009A4EVM).  I bought the movie on UMD in 2004 or 2005 and tried to watch it on a trip. The PSP screen stunk in direct light and I couldn't really watch any of the movie.  I could hear it and have an idea what was going on, but had a hard time following it.  

I plugged Tron into my Netflix movie queue in 2008 and it finally reached its way to the top of the list in spring 2010.  I really enjoyed the movie. I recommend watching the movie after watching another movie from the early 1980s so that you can compare the special effects.  Disney did a great job for the time and I can understand why this movie has a lot of respect in pop culture.  

Unfortunately, this shirt is no longer available from Think Geek.  I totally recommend [this one](http://www.threadless.com/submission/154766/The_Electronic_Gladiator) if you are looking for a sweet TRON shirt/hoodie.

TRON: Legacy comes out in December this year and I'm going to proudly wear this shirt when I go to watch it.
