I came to grips with it a while ago.  I'm a pansy. The only time I was remotely awesome was during my paintball stint.  I played at D-Day and it was kinda cool acting crazy and screaming random insane war cries (IE: Leeroy Jenkins!! and random phrases from the movie DodgeBall). That was a long time ago, and I'm a bit overweight now.

My Dad and brother ran the Tulsa Marathon a few weekends ago.  It was my Dad's 32nd marathon and the first since his triple bypass in December 2009.  This was my brother's first one.  There is no way I could pull off a marathon with a year of training.  

However, my brother showed me this "thing" of awesomeness. It is called... THE WARRIOR DASH!  Check it out at [http://warriordash.com/](http://warriordash.com/).

Here is just a taste of the awesomeness from their FAQ.


Warrior Dash is the ultimate event for thrill-seeking athletes. This running series is held on some of the nation's most demanding and unique terrain. Participants will conquer extreme obstacles and celebrate their feat with music, beer, warrior helmets and muddy shorts.


I'm thoroughly excited about this event. It's going to be AWESOME!!!!
