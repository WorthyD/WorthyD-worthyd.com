Thankfully, there is an awesome app available that lets you store code snippets in groups.  That app is [Snippely](http://code.google.com/p/snippely/).  I'm a big fan of AIR apps and this is one of the best ones I've found.

I currently have eight groups that are based on specific languages or variations of languages. I occasionally need to target IE6 or 7 or get a CSS reset and it is a lot easier to access than frequently having to frequently re-Google stuff.  I primarily use Snippely for SQL Scripts, raw javascript, my [CLog Code](http://worthyd.com/techblog/index.php/2010/07/the-console/) ,and CSS resets/targeting.

Obviously, Snippely has uses besides storing code. Experiment with it and see what you think.  It's hosted on code.google.com and downloads can be found [here](http://code.google.com/p/snippely/downloads/list)
