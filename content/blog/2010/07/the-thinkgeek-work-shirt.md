I kinda have this thing going at work where I wear a geek and video game shirts.  I try to balance it to remain somewhat professional.  Thursdays are geek shirts and Fridays are video game shirts.  I'd say I almost have a following at work. 

Most of my shirts have interesting stories behind them that I will share here.  Some are really awkward situations I've been in while wearing them and others are the ways I acquired them.  I'll try to keep to the point on the posts and include pictures but I'm still working on getting this blog up and running 100%.

Rocking my ThinkGeek work shirt today. It can be found [here](http://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts-apparel/golfshirts/6616/).  

I've gotten a lot of compliments and laughs out of the shirt. I love it.  I've always been a fan of the Dickies style work shirts and jackets.  I'd add a patch to it if I get one that would properly match.  I'd have to say that this is my favorite geek shirt.... even though I've been asked multiple times "How much is unleaded" while wearing it.
