I'm proudly wearing my Scrap Metal R2D2 shirt that I purchased from [Think Geek](http://www.thinkgeek.com).  Star Wars shirts always get a lot of praise at my work.  I got this shirt by luck from Think Geek for only $6!  They had a random shirt sale and I ordered three.  I was very satisfied with two of the three so I feel like I won out big time.

R2 is definitely the biggest (well technically smallest) hero in the Star Wars Saga.  He's never a coward and beeps in the face of danger!  I was going to say that this shirt is an ironic because R2 never gets ripped apart like 3PO or any limbs cut off like the Skywalkers.  I feel his portrayal by Cleveland in  Family Guy's Blue Harvest is spot on when he leans out the window of the Falcon and his arm comes out with a gun. He screams "YEA-HEAH!!! That's how we do it in my neighborhood, b****!" after blowing up some Tie Fighters.

If they re-release Star Wars again, they better include R2-D2 subtitle.
