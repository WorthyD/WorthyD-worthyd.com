This is really the black sheep of my Zelda shirt collection (about 4 or 5 shirts).  It was available only at Game Stop for pre-ordering the Game Cube version of the 4 Sword Adventure.  I haven't ever seen someone else wearing it and I've only found a few images of it on the internet.

I'm a big fan of Zelda merchandise. I have a bunch of shirts, two wrist bands, a running jacket, a hoodie, annnnnnnnd a custom made Link Halloween costume that I haven't fit in for a couple years that a friend made me back in '04.  I'm always on the lookout for new sweet Zelda shirts.

The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past was one of the first games that I played through more than 10 times.  I "beat" Mega Man 3 over 20 times in one month in third grade, but it was due to passwords and the left arrow on the player 2 controller. I'm pretty loyal to the first 4 games. Unfortunately the direction the game has taken isn't my cup of tea.  

I like the shirt. It's basic and straight to the point.  I wasn't originally planning on wearing this shirt today, but the one I wanted to wear was purchased yesterday. I haven't had the opportunity to wash it yet.  Maybe we'll be ready for my new Mario shirt next Friday.
