I was fortunate enough to get a new laptop at work the past week.  I had a friend point me to [Ninite.com](http://ninite.com/).  Go to their site, select the apps you want on your PC, download their installer and run the installer after its done downloading.  

The installer will install the first application that is fully downloaded and continue downloading the other applications.  It took a while to install the 30 apps I wanted, but I never had to do anything after running the installer.  The absolute best part is that no toolbars are installed!
