I talked to a coworker of mine after the never-text.info fiasco and got inspired to build an unlike tool since Facebook doesn't have one. So I bring to you [UnlikeStuff.com](http://unlikestuff.com/).  

Before you check out the site, I'm a web developer. I'm by no means a designer in any way shape or form.  The site was _thrown_ together in my spare time.

I have a lot of ideas in-store for the site and I'll try to make them when I can. But until then, enjoy.
