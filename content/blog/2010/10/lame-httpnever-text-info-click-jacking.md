[Never-Text.info](http://never-text.info) is running a nice little click scam.  They got me, but I like to think I'm clever when it comes to using firebug.  I dug through and actually copied their "like" button iframe.  I uploaded a page so that you can actually see the page and unlike it.

Don't believe their 1 mil hype. There were only 200K likers when I checked.
