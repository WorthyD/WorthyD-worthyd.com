## Saw a pic the other day. A pic to change the world! - 2008-04-01 11:56:53

Three identical police cars were on the back of a flat bed truck in California.... all with Decepticon logos on them..... filming of Transformers 2? I think so! And Starscream wasn't the only survivor.

Note to self

When one headphone speaker is ripped out... songs don't sound the same.

## Woes of the Wii - 2008-04-25 12:55:25

Mario Kart Wii release tomorrow night at midnight. Guess who is going to be a the Bentonville Sam's Club hanging out?

Zelda Hacked: Parallel Worlds update: Game is damn hard can't even get to the point where I get a sword.  It is suppose to take an hour to get it.  I can play through LTTP in my sleep.  Maybe my next attempt tonight will be more adventurous.

## Mario Kart Wii - 2008-04-27 11:54:54

Midnight launch at Sam's Club in Bentonville was rather cool. Hung out with a couple people my age at the door....except they were there to get a Wii for their 7 year old kid.... and I was just there for the game... my loving wife went with me so I could entertain her.

The way they handled the release was rather dumb however. They made everyone wait at the door and only let in people 4 at a time into a space about the size of a three bedroom apartment. They had blocked off the rest of the store with 10 foot tall pallets of charmin ultra.

Anyway, after two rounds online (one battle and one regular race) at 12:30am I decided to go to bed. Here is what I think so far.

1\. People from Japan are REALLY good
2\. Using the wheel is more difficult than I expected.
IV. This game is going to provide many fun times
