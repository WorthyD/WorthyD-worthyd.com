BRING BACK THE SUPER SCOPE!!!!!!!!!

Mario Kart Wii release tomorrow night at midnight. Guess who is going to be a the Bentonville Sam's Club rockin out!

Zelda Hacked: Parallel Worlds update: Game is damn hard can't even get to the point where I get a sword.  It is suppose to take an hour to get it.  I can play through LTTP in my sleep.  Maybe my next attempt tonight will be more adventurous.
