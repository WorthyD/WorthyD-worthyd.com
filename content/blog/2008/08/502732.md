I know I haven't been the most loyal gamer the past few years. However, I do think that you should develop for the iphone. I really think an FF port would be really cool.... heck even an Mystic Quest port! It wasn't THAT bad of a game. I'd pay 4.99 for that entertainment. Vay isn't entertaining me enough during scout meetings.

PS Thank you for helping me find my GBA Micro charger so I can play FFVI, FFIV and FFT:A. :-D
