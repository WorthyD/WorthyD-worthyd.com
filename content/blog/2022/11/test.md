Lï»¿ife happens. It's been roughly 15 years since I've played paintball. It used to be a every weekend thing when I was in college. My boss from the paintball store posted a picture of an old paintball VHS back in July on his Instagram. I decided to watch the movie and nostalgia hit me really really hard. It took me about a month to gather up the courage to ask him if I could join the group at the yearly big game event in September. I reassembled my gear and met up with them. I was welcomed back into the fold with open arms. It was an amazing experience and we are already talking about next year's event.
