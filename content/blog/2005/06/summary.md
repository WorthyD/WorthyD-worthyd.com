.hack//GU is 60% done. I'm excited. The World has a gang of Player Killers. THIS series will span 3 games.... each one being longer than the previous 4 game series PUT INTO ONE! So I expect 90 hours in each game.... I'm excited. It wont come out for a while though. Mid 2006 i think. As long as it stays on the PS2 I'll be happy.

Dad's doing great.

Elder Scrolls Morrowind is great.

Washing new dark blue jeans with white socks in cold water isn't good :)

I got to see Peggy Sue and Clark today. I haven't gotten to see them in a while. Threw the frisbee for a while. It was a lot of fun.

I was hit really hard today with my urge to open a store in Rogers/Bentonville, but I know I HAVE to finish school before I do that. It is very sad to me :(

Elder Scrolls: Oblivion looks awesome.. I want it.... I'm afraid that game will have a huge factor in which system I purchase when the next BIG THREE are released. HOWEVER, I am not purchasing one until I KNOW they are solid. I bought the cube way too early and the PS2 way too late and the XBox WAY late.

Going down to the Fort tomorrow for a crawfish cookout. It's going to be fun too.

I became a captain today in the theives guild. I think I
want to start over already. I'm really tempted to create
a knight of some kind. I look like a badass
ninja right now. I only have a couple ranks to go in the
thieves guild. Oh well. I guess I'll
start a new game as a knight tonight. It's what I
originally wanted to be so why not?
Morrowind is just so much fun. It beats just about
every RPG I've ever played. I remember when i thought this was the
only good RPG for XBox. I was always hoping
Nintendo would put out a hit or two from time to time that would catch my
eye, but only the legend of zelda games have done me any good.
Twilight Princess should be bad ass though. I'll reserve it in
October when I get the money. It looks good. I really
hope it doesn't disappoint me. I'm pretty sure I will like
over time. That is what happened with the
legend of zelda: Wind Waker. I really
didn't like the original graphics at all
and after playing it I realized why it was so awesome. I'm
not really sure what I'm worried about with the this one.
Daniel worries way too freaking much about stupid crap
like this. Can you tell? I can get really
old after a while. I'm going to go play until I get
very tired. :) You wont see me again until tomorrow
evening... maybe.. ok probably not ^\_^

Newest game informer magazine came when I was gone. VERY VERY good info in it.

XBox 360, Revolution, and PS3 info!

Game Boy Micro info!

FFVI may be getting "special attention"

New Rockstar(Grand Theft Auto) game Titled "Bully" look very controversial, but still cool

Perfect Dark Zero info.

Adam Sandler is getting into video games. Happy Gilmore Mini Golf?

whats the real kicker?
I want all the systems, but I KNOW i wont be able to afford all of them.

Heading to Kansas City tomorrow for the warped tour peace out homies.

Just got back from the Warped Tour in Kansas City. Lots of fun... lots of people... not really my scene, but I enjoyed myself.

Ed declared me a true emo boy.... too bad I don't have the style or ultra skinny body. _shrugs_

We hung out with Strike Anywhere for a while. They were really really cool. All bands there were great. I'd figured bands on tour would be grumpy and stuff. Just shows how much I know.

My nose is really burned. Everywhere else is fine though. I saw people blistering by the end of the day.

Damage reports. Two broken noses, one passed out girl, and tons of people throwing up.... yeah that wasn't fun.

Too many people with bad punk tattoos. Many cute girls in black and pink ^\_^ with multi colored hair.

Really good day today at work.

Jeron, the grocery manager, allowed me to order with him. One step to becoming more important.

Jennifer, the closing manager, gave me many complements on my work today.

After work I went to the U of A to print off score sheets for the tournament. I saw Peggy Sue's Mustang outside of the cafeteria. I went and printed off my stuff. On the way back out I left her a note.

Went over to Gilley's and picked up Gilley and Jason.

Went to the Fort around 7:30. Got to Andy's around 8:30. We headed to the field after we had dinner.

Got to the field around 9:30 and finished the field around 1:30 (This is 1:30 AM not 1:30 PM)

Went back to Andy's and watched videos of Dirt at the National Tournaments.

Woke up at 7 and headed to the field.

Registration went great. 9 Teams showed up. Two of my refs didn't show up. 2 out of 7.... which is pretty killer.

Middle of the day an Oklahoma team starting string up shit and were really sore losers. Pretty much ruined the day.

We all had bad calls and good calls. Overall MOST people were happy and having fun. It was hot as hell and I almost passed out.

We finished off the day and Gilley, Jason and Andy dumped an ice water filled 5 gallon cooler on me. It was too cold. I think I almost went into shock.
