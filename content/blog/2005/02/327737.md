This game was an upset for me. There was just so much that didn't please me. The level system was too easy to take advantage of. There was no real background story behind any of the characters. FFIV and VI set the standard for me and its really hard for a FF to be able to beat them overall.

The final boss was a joke when I was wielding blood swords. Two rounds and he was gone.

Not much of an ending. I didn't catch the traditional FF theme song that I enjoy.

FFV is up next at about 3/4s done.

Then its FFIII via rom.... then the dragon warrior series.
