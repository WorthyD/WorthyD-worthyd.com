My laptop is officially dead. I've reformatted it several times and it wont stay on. I'm sure I could fix it... but its a hardware issue and I don't want to spend the money to fix it, since it was free. I haven't used it in months. It was a parting gift from Tyson.

Brandon and I played Racket(wrong sp i'm sure) ball and ran a mile afterwards. I'm terribly out of shape. Its not cool at all :) I have something to work towards though.

I need to talk to Heather about my possible position at Sam's club I've been wanting for some time. Yarg I'll just call her or something :)

I try hard not to do this, but I know sometimes its just dumb. People bringing in dinner to the lab. This is the ISYS lab so there is NEVER a lab technitian or however you spell it on duty. Candy bars and chips I can understand, but food that has aroma that covers the whole room in not acceptable in my opinion :-P Also people who play music without head phones..... I'll go download some RvB and play it loud ^\_^ that will be fun /End Bishing.

Thursday I'm giving blood. A friend talked me into it... yeah... I'm evil like that....

## Daniel has the hook up. Should he take it? - 2005-02-01 16:14:37

I was told I could get a free anodizing (color) job ($300 value) through my friends at DirtProducts.com if .... If I purchase a new marker of course. I don't have anything worth coloring right now.

Attempted to give blood, but my vein clotted when the bag was 3/4s full.

I'm heading back to fayetteville.

I'm currently on my second generation of Store Kids. The first generation is in highschool and most have just quit paintball.

One thing for sure about the kids. They can't keep the same gun for a month. They are always trading and trying to get something better.
I've owned many markers myself, but I've had the same primary marker for 3 years now. Its worth $1300 new. On ebay I couldn't get $400 for it if I tried at all. I've had a whole arsenal of back up guns and experimental guns.

One of my first gen Store Kids started off with a nasty right feed cocker. Some how he managed to end up with an LCD Angel. There is a $500 dollar difference in the two guns. He had no less than 5 guns in between. Maybe 2 of them worked properly that I messed with constantly.

One of my few Good new Kids purchased an LCD Adrenaline that the owner of the store and myself had been trying to scrounge up money for for a long time. Ed told him that he never needed a different gun EVER. Which was true. The next week he comes into the store asking what he should do to it to make it shoot awesome. I told him its already pimped out and ready to go.

Last week he came into the store with a friend. He is selling the gun to his friend for $450. We sold him the gun for $650 and he's only had it several months. Yeah, I was a little mad. If he wasn't so young (14 or 15) I'd threaten to punch him in the teeth.

This morning he posted pictures of his new mask on the nwa forums. Right beside his ghetto rasta mask was a gun that I had seen in the store OFTEN BROKEN. I can't stand seeing kids trade these guns. I know this gun is going to break down on him constantly.

Here are several other equations I've seen from the store kids.

Vertibrate Eblade barely used worth 1500 new, but 900 used for a Red A4 worth 1400 new 1100 used.

Orracle Eblade (800) + Vertibrate Eblade (900 rare) for an $800 Alias

Red A4($1100) + 2k2 Timmy ($800) for a $800 Alias

(Yeah Aliases are in and the hot thing to shoot)

When will these kids learn. They don't listen to me. Not my money. Oh well.

Long day.

Drove to springdale to get my hair cut

Drove back to fayetteville to work.

Had a $1700 day. Between helping customers and trying to fix guns I didn't have time to do anything. This is the most busy day of the year so far. Average saturday brings in 800 bucks around this time of the year.

Ugh now that I think about it, I need to look up a fix on the internet. YAY!!!!!

I had a ghetto epiphany or however you spell it. Around 11, when I was fixing a marker, I realized the only thing I'm good at is fixing things. For me to actually be successful with ease, I probably should drop out of college and jump into a vocational school.

Until then I'm going to bed... after I look up the fix for the dumb dumb A-5

I have another nail in my tire. I'm not happy. I'm going to go run my butt off if the Hper is open after the APO meeting.

## Did you just shoot yourself in the foot? Yes sir, That happens from time to time. - 2005-02-08 11:09:03

I think my long time back problems are because I have a fat wallet... full of pointless cards. I haven't had my wallet in my pocket all week and i've felt great. Last week my back was killing me... strange.

I went to the career fair and I was completely ignored! It was awesome. I just walked around amongst the people and snatched brochures. I hope I got enough of them. I avoided Tyson... but I probably shouldn't have.

So I tore my room apart looking for my RF switch. I last place I looked was in my PS2 box... that is kinda on display.
![alt](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v432/shadow_x/mydesk.jpg) Big blue box in the center.

Yeah I looked in it while loading up the game boxes above it. Looked down and thought. Thats those are those dumb AV cables that don't work. I took the box in my mouth to reach in and grab them. I kept telling myself "Where the heck is that darn RF switch"... I look down and turns out the connecting part of AV cables are just like the RF switch..... yeah I'm dumb.... That happens from time to time :)

I'm off to B&E; to study.

Customer comes into the store with a broken marker. I ask him what I can do for him. He wants me to fix his marker. I ask him whats wrong with it. He says its leaking everywhere. I gas it up and the smell of WD-40 reeks allllll over the store.

Now lets pause the situation for one moment.

What does WD-40 do? It makes metal on metal glide back and forth easier. Makes hinges not squeak. Destroys the sticky parts of stickers.. and it smells HORRIBLE.

Paintball markers have o-rings in them. Teflon orings. Teflon isn't exactly the most durable thing in the world. There are anywhere from 5 to 30 o-rings in a paintball marker. Generally if one or two of them are bad teh marker is not going to function well at all.

Now if you don't know what you are doing, why are you going to lube your gun with something that smells TERRIBLE and is designed for metal on metal inside a marker that has very sensitive pneumatics.

Lets go back now.

I told him it smelled like WD-40. He said he was a "MASTER GUN SMITH" and figured it's what he needed to use. I looked at him with a blank face and said that WD-40 destroys the o-rings in paintball markers. I was told this by Terry Pneumaster (ironicly thats his real last name and he really is a master of pneumatics) who is very very high in development of new markers at Brass Eagle. Yes, the company sucks, but its not Terry's fault. It's their manufacturers. He hand makes AWESOME markers.

I took the marker in the back and spent 30 minutes cleaning the NASTY CRAP out of it. Replaced all o-rings and the valve.

It cost this guy $35 because he thought a paintball gun was the same as a real gun..... people need to use more common sense.

I'm amazed at some people. When people are asked to stop talking, how hard is it to stop talking? Why use profanity when not necessary? You set yourself sky high when you do dumb stuff like that.

So anyway, the tournament went well in Fort Smith today. I pulled two 1 for 1s and tackled a guy.

Here's what happened
2 Vs 3 near end of game

JL 1 and JL 2 were kicking it in a back bunker blasting paint like crazy.

GZ 1 comes around and blasts JL 1 in the face.
GZ 2 comes around and blasts JL 2 in the face and JL 1 in the back.
JL 2 screams to JL 1 that he is still in. I am screaming they are both out.
GZ 3 runs up the side of the field blasting JL 2 as I'm running to pull his armband
JL 2 keeps running blasting GZ 3. I tackle JL 2 because he's been playing on for over 15 seconds.

 Nothing I couldn't handle. After I left I heard some serious crap almost went down. I would have had a DAY if I was down there.
