Yesterday was kinda fun. Got to ref a tournament. As always there were jerks who pretty much ruined the day for the refs. This time it is a little more amusing than last time. A little rock team came up to play the tournament they finished in the prelims in first and I had to pull a couple penalties because they were a little trigger happy on a guy. During the finals the last game I pulled the guy who hung the flag because he had an unobvious hit on his tank. This took them out of first place overall. I didn't know this until 30 minutes later when he told me I "Fucked them out of first place". It really boggles my mind that he actually thought i intentionally screwed them over on purpose.... whatever.....It's guys like him that make me want to quit playing paintball.
