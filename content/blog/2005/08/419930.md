So apparently I no longer work at Harps. I came home today and I got a letter yesterday that was a survey on how Harps could be better to their employees. I called my manager and he said it was probably a mistake. I think it's funny, but I just hope everything gets straightened up soon :)

This week was great at the store. Highest sales in a week since April. I was happy :)

Awesome weekend.
