Slow day. I couldn't sleep well last night so I stayed up and played Tales of Symphonia for an hour or two and then read a couple chapters in the second Harry Potter book. I took some Ibprofuen and put the first potter movie and fell asleep shortly after the sorting hat scene.

Kicked it with Ed and Bill this morning. I took a dremel tool to my Halo loader. Hopefully it will fix all the problems I had the other day. I got a skeletor snow cone from bryce and it was GREAT.

I'm going to play tales of symphonia for a while now.

So apparently I no longer work at Harps. I came home today and I got a letter yesterday that was a survey on how Harps could be better to their employees. I called my manager and he said it was probably a mistake. I think it's funny, but I just hope everything gets straightened up soon :)

This week was great at the store. Highest sales in a week since April. I was happy :)

Awesome weekend.

New Zelda game has been delayed.... until march 2006.... this makes me sad... but only for a moment because I still think(Hope) Dragon Quest VIII is coming out in november. I have plenty of games to keep me entertained....

I'm considering going out and buy Luigi's Mansion for the Game Cube... it looks like a blast.

I really hope practice goes well this weekend.

I think I'm a couple hours away from finishing Tales of Symphonia. The story has gone all sorts of messed up. I should be able to finish it some time soon. No hurry though. Been a very enjoyable game. I get to work a 10 to 7 shift today. I love getting to work 10 to 7. Anyway... I'm going to go blah around and not do my home work before work today.. thankfully i have no required home work. :)

Yesterday was kinda fun. Got to ref a tournament. As always there were jerks who pretty much ruined the day for the refs. This time it is a little more amusing than last time. A little rock team came up to play the tournament they finished in the prelims in first and I had to pull a couple penalties because they were a little trigger happy on a guy. During the finals the last game I pulled the guy who hung the flag because he had an unobvious hit on his tank. This took them out of first place overall. I didn't know this until 30 minutes later when he told me I "Fucked them out of first place". It really boggles my mind that he actually thought i intentionally screwed them over on purpose.... whatever.....It's guys like him that make me want to quit playing paintball.
