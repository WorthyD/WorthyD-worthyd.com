Slow day. I couldn't sleep well last night so I stayed up and played Tales of Symphonia for an hour or two and then read a couple chapters in the second Harry Potter book. I took some Ibprofuen and put the first potter movie and fell asleep shortly after the sorting hat scene.

Kicked it with Ed and Bill this morning. I took a dremel tool to my Halo loader. Hopefully it will fix all the problems I had the other day. I got a skeletor snow cone from bryce and it was GREAT.

I'm going to play tales of symphonia for a while now.
