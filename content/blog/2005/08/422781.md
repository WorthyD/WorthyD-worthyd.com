I think I'm a couple hours away from finishing Tales of Symphonia. The story has gone all sorts of messed up. I should be able to finish it some time soon. No hurry though. Been a very enjoyable game. I get to work a 10 to 7 shift today. I love getting to work 10 to 7. Anyway... I'm going to go blah around and not do my home work before work today.. thankfully i have no required home work. :)
