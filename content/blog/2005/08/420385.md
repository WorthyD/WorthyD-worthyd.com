New Zelda game has been delayed.... until march 2006.... this makes me sad... but only for a moment because I still think(Hope) Dragon Quest VIII is coming out in november. I have plenty of games to keep me entertained....

I'm considering going out and buy Luigi's Mansion for the Game Cube... it looks like a blast.

I really hope practice goes well this weekend.
