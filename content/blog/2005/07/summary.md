Went to the Music Hall with Kyle and Gilley.

Gilley and I got our butts kicked at some Street Fighter II by some random girl. The arcade versions are so much different than what I am use to. I wasn't aware of all the mid-air moves and stuff you could do. I saw a guy just stay in air by constantly firing diagonal fire balls... yes on the Street Fighter II that was released in like 94!

Gotta swallow your pride some time _shrugs_

Turns out the biggest name in the original Ninja Turtles Movie is the "head thug".. its Sam Rockwell..... the bad guy from the Green Mile.....Zaphod Beeblebrox from the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy.... yeah ... this guy is the ONLY person with an active acting career. The Shredder has done a lot of cartoon voice work.... but yeah.... that is AWESOME!

How the heck did the party community find my neighbor hood? Two years here and there has never been a party where both sides of the street were packed with parked cars. Holy hell it looks like a freakin frat party... whatever

Had a good busy day at work.

Picked up Tales of Symphonia for a dirt cheap price and also reserved Dragon Quest VIII which looks to be the only game i REALLY want to play coming out any time soon.

Saw Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with Sue Ellen. Movie was great.

Went to practice in this darn hot weather.

Talked to for about an hour before we started playing. Her boyfriend kept giving us hell which was rather funny.

As much as I love playing with Justice League they are the slow to get ready for games. We ran 2 on 2 re-insertion which quickly went to hell because the rules weren't clearly explained to both sides. Then we sat for an hour and then they did breakout drills which ALSO quickly went to crap considering two or three players thought it was suppose to be a 15 second game. One guy just ran down the field blasting and ended up upsetting everyone because he would never do that in a real game.

Over all it was decently fun.

Well my first attempt at Lunar was an utter failure. I got destroyed in the second battle I encountered. I threw in Tales of Symphonia to see what the controlling is like and what the story is about. I liked it... we will see which one I actually play first :-P

I spent an hour or so trying to fix mom and dad's computer. I think the mother board is fried... now I get to go to the dentist... yay...

Attempted Lunar again... got shot down hard core... i'm going to play Tales of Symphonia instead.... yeah....

Just found out an old highschool buddy just got an LJ. I is happy :)
