A minute before I leave B&E; to go to Harps, a guy runs full speed past our door at B&E.; I didn't think anything of it. A minute later when I'm on my way to Harps. Brian, the frozen dairy manger, asked me if I saw the guy... I said yes... turns out this guy stole some lunch meat from our deli. We walked around the outlet mall to see if he was hiding behind B&E;, the card store, or the movie theater. We expected him to be huddled up in a corner munching on the meat like a chipmunk.

Election committee meeting went very well. I'm excited about the people slated for positions. Next semester for APO should be great.

Melissa and I were nominated for the same position so we had to leave the room while they decided. We had a very good talk.

I made an attempt to get to the final palace in Zelda II.... note the to and not through! yeah.... darn flying eyes and bottomless pits!

## Taking on a childhood challenge - 2005-04-22 05:17:45

I've always been terribly scared of Zelda II. I give it three weeks to complete the final palace before I move on to newer and better things(hopefully better). This means me playing Majora's Mask. Hopefully this time around I wont get too angry at the whole three day stupid thing.... yeah... then i'll finish dark cloud 2... then lunar... ^\_^ I love being a gamer

Purchased a 12 inch drill press today with my own money for B&E.; I should make my money back quickly. I need to get a soldering gun now.

Concert was a lot of fun.

Within a matter of 15 minutes I saw two people I went to highschool with. If I had driven down there I would have hung out with them afterwards, but I was just a tag along so I didn't really have any power at all.

Taking Back Sunday was GREAT. I'm a little poser and didn't recognize half the songs, but I still enjoyed it all. The other half have been on Warp Tour CDs and Jawwbraker Paintball Video Magazine. Gooooooood stuff!

Work was way too slow today. I did get to talk to a couple really cool kids though. I'm impressed with how many young players come in with their parents and are extremely polite and full of questions. It makes my job worth while :)

Ed was having a cookout at his place after work. I stopped by and talked to everyone for a while. It was cool.

I'm really pumped about the Memphis Indoor this year. Its a 5 man paintball tournament that Ed and Dirt has played for the past 4 years. I hope to drag all the guys to it. It should be a lot of fun.

Old School Metroid is very hard!

Made it to the final palace in Zelda II in about my 20th try. I died once on the way there... i lost my other two lives promptly after walking into the door. This game is tediously hard! I selected continue... took me back to teh beginning of the palace. YAY! Got about half way through then died... yeah that sucked. Chose to save... started the game again... back at Hyrule castle..... yeah... I wasn't too happy about that. I wish this game wasn't so difficult.

Back to writing my paper(s)
