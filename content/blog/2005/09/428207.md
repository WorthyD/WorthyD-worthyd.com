Turns out I'm 46 hours away from graduating... 34 after this semester. Looks like I have another full year at school.

Good News:
I'll be able to play for the U of A another season
One of the semesters will be straight BS easy classes. Like freshmen stuff :)

Bad News:
Not graduating any time soon :)

Here are some fun statistics for you! :)

- \# of As:5(1 of them in a lab)
- \# of Bs:9(2 in labs)
- \# of Cs:13
- \# of Ds:2

and I got through Highschool with a 3.7 GPA ^_^ with only ONE C ever... and it was in an AP class :)

Old School is a funny movie :)
