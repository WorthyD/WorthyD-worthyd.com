I had a little panic attack this morning.... what am I going to do if my small business falls through? What if I can never get it off the ground? I realized my parents had it a lot worse when they got tried to start their careers.

I've been at home all morning.... for the first time in a couple months. I've cleaned the heck out of my room and attempted to move around some furniture.... I don't know if I'm going to leave it like this. It should be a lot easier to play video games and watch TV on my futon.

As some of you have noticed I'm never home to be online. I'm at home only to sleep pretty much now. I've slowly drawn away from the internet. I still read the updates.... but usually 24 hours or so after they have been posted and then commenting just doesn't have the same effect.. I still think about everyone when I'm at work all the time and I really miss getting to talk to everyone.

I'm really wanting to get a good amount of money saved up before I get out of college so that I wont have to live at home very long after I graduate.
