Turns out that the cash office position isn't suitable for me. Oh well. There are other promotions I'm going to work on.

So here is what I did this morning.

Went to the bank, deposited my check. Went to old navy to get a new pair of jeans. Went to game stop, sold 18 games and got enough to pay very little for a game boy micro.

Went to Futon Mattress world and got a 11 layer mattress and cover (paid for by my parents).
Came home and cleaned the hell out of my room... now I'm just kicking it.

I'm going to fill out a survey, throw it on MySpace and LJ. Then input all my purchases for the month into an Excel spread sheet for personal financial management.

Parents are home tonight.. no loudness... but I have a LARGE amount of IBC Root Beer and Cream Soda from Harps because it's on sale ^_^
