I'm biting off more than I can chew right now. Me becoming a closing manager pretty much has killed my nights during the week and has given me a 12 hour work day on saturday. Work and class stress are hurting me. This semester I cannot do APO. Work isn't fully to blame on this, it is also my class schedule for being so messed up thanks to the university. Sorry guys. I will try next semester. Maybe by then I wont have to close at Harps so much and I wont have an awkward class schedule.
