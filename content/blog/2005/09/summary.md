I'm biting off more than I can chew right now. Me becoming a closing manager pretty much has killed my nights during the week and has given me a 12 hour work day on saturday. Work and class stress are hurting me. This semester I cannot do APO. Work isn't fully to blame on this, it is also my class schedule for being so messed up thanks to the university. Sorry guys. I will try next semester. Maybe by then I wont have to close at Harps so much and I wont have an awkward class schedule.

Walking around I've realized a couple things.

1\. This campus will never stop having dump trucks and heavy equipment on it.

2\. Three hour classes are long

Good day so far. I've devised a method of staying awake in class however it woke keep my attention on the teacher.

Freezers went out in the store 20 minutes before we closed. This is a BIG TIME oh crap. I had to hang around another hour and 15 minutes or so for the store manager and repairman to show up. I'm really tired. I don't even want to think about how much product was ruined.

I'm going to have to sit down and talk with my boss at Harps. He scheduled me on next Sunday.... I have practice... i honestly don't know who's upset more... me or my girlfriend..... she likes watching me play and knows how important it is that my team practices before back to back weekend tournaments.

I had a little panic attack this morning.... what am I going to do if my small business falls through? What if I can never get it off the ground? I realized my parents had it a lot worse when they got tried to start their careers.

I've been at home all morning.... for the first time in a couple months. I've cleaned the heck out of my room and attempted to move around some furniture.... I don't know if I'm going to leave it like this. It should be a lot easier to play video games and watch TV on my futon.

As some of you have noticed I'm never home to be online. I'm at home only to sleep pretty much now. I've slowly drawn away from the internet. I still read the updates.... but usually 24 hours or so after they have been posted and then commenting just doesn't have the same effect.. I still think about everyone when I'm at work all the time and I really miss getting to talk to everyone.

I'm really wanting to get a good amount of money saved up before I get out of college so that I wont have to live at home very long after I graduate.

The new game boy micro comes with a widget to help change face plates!!!

[quote from IGN article titled "GBA Micro in Box"]
Left: Game Boy Micro comes with the system, two additional faceplates, AC adapter, **a widget to pop the faceplates off,** documentation, and a carrying sock. Right: Silver and Black Game Boy Micros. Complete with finger grease.

That has to be the GREATEST THING EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Truth be told I don't know what a widget is... but it's an awesome word.

I was hoping it was a small mythological creature that specializes in the removal of plastic face plates... turns out its a piece of plastic.... how disappointing.

Edit #1:
Test 1 out of 3 completed. Wasn't too difficult. I didn't study the stuff I should have though, but there was really no way of me knowing that. Teacher said study the power points, but never said "Focus on theories". No big deal. The next test is in a month and a half and I'll probably know what to focus on more then.

I'm going to have to figure something out. Trillian really is lame with contacts.... if I delete a contact off of trillain and then log onto aim, the contact comes back! if I go back into trillian.... it's back again! When I signed up for Trillian last summer I had a large number of reincarnated contacts from when I first used Trillian in 2000. Yeah, absolute random people showed up on my list or at least I thought they were random..... yeah...

Edit #2:
Test 2 sucked! Like AWFUL!.... yeah It was an essay test and I couldn't concentrate to SAVE MY LIFE. There is just too much on my mind to focus right now. Paintball, work, cottage cheese, you know the deal.... this next test should be cake though. Multiple choice and the teacher read out the entire test and gave us the answers.... and I wrote them all down... and I already knew the answers because of common sense. Yeah cake walk !\

Edit #3:
Test 3 was a joke. Finished in less than 15 minutes and no less than 20 people finished before me... there were 50 questions... yeah... it was a joke. I'm off to BE

So here's a real update

Friday I get up a little early because I need money for the trip. Head to wal-mart for batteries and then the new Harps for foodies.... I see my old store manager and I talked to her for a while. I'm thinking about transferring and taking a position over there as the frozen/dairy manager. I'm more interested in that then closing manager.

Jason and I head up to IL by ourselves since we got out of class earliest... well since he did. I don't have class on fridays. Long LONG trip... We get to the hotel around 7:30 and I brought an XBox to watch movies while we wait for the other guys.... the TV didn't have an AV cable hookup so I was screwed. I used Jason's phone to call kyle and tell him to buy me an rf switch on the way up. We get tired of waiting and I go to sleep.

Around 11:30pm I wake up with Gilley on top of me. Kyle threw the RF adapter on my head, turns out that he got me one that will work on all the systems I own, which is awesome.

Tournament day went great. Prelims were six games. Three games on one field, then three games on another field. The first field probably had 15 bunkers to 10 players. Yeah it really sucked. We used a TON of paint. Our last three games were played on a 7-man field. Close to 30 bunkers on this field. Definitely a moving and dominating field. We won our first game in 15 seconds... it was awful. I did die on the break though. We fixed the problem the next game and dominated yet again. Third game on the field we played Southern Illinois State... yeah this is the team we played at KState last year with the guy with the warp feed.... It was great. At the end of the game King Ben's gun was pulled and checked for bouncing problems. His gun was taking off shooting like crazy. Wasn't doing it earlier in the day. We were docked 100 points, but still locked in the semi finals.

Semifinals were three games. We won all three games very convincingly.

Finals were three games also. We were all really really tired. We didn't have a real lunch and a really sorry excuse for a breakfast.

After finals were over I could barely stand I was so tired. I felt like I was going to pass out.

They handed out free beer after the tournament... yeah... free beer to dehydrated paintballers who haven't eaten all day... genius if you ask me. I was tired and not in the right state of mind, I wanted to go back to the hotel and have a couple beers there, but Kyle heard about a players party some where and we decided to do that. On the way home, Kyle drove THROUGH a corn field... not on a road by a corn field... THROUGH IT! He drove about 20 feet into it, turned around and drove out. THey stole some corn too! He still have corn husks in his grill when he made it back to the hotel.

We went back to the hotel, showered, ate cracker barrel, and then went to a player's party thirty minutes away. We kicked it with the 5 illinois state guys from 11:00 to about 2:00 and I was the DD. Now I had fun until about 12 or so. I just wanted to go to the hotel and get some sleep because I was DEAD TIRED as was Jason.

We managed to gather everyone up and take off around 2 or so.... street lights in illinois are twice as bright as the ones in arkansas... and illinois smells like play-doh...... Driving with two highly intoxicated teammates is a little difficult.. especially when you are extremely tired. WHen I'm tired I turn the radio up and blast some AC... I couldn't do that because they all got mad when I did. We got to the hotel and i CRASHED.

Woke up around 9:30 this morning and took a shower. Jason woke up and took one too. We packed up and were gone by 10:30. The drive home kinda sucked because of all the rain that hit us. Nasty conditions. Car was humid and it was cold outside. I did finish Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire on the way back. I'm so ready for the movie. Kyle, Gilley, King Ben, and Erik left around 1 I think.

Got home, went to an APO meeting, ate dinner with Laura, came home... realized mom and dad are out of town til Wednesday... and there you go!

More job opportunities that I probably should take. Part time cash office manager at Store #108 which is a lot closer to my house. I'm gonna go talk to the guy tomorrow morning.

I found a METROID ACTION FIGURE AT WORK TODAY!!!!! $5 for a six inch tall Samus action figure!!!!!!!!! Oh yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Fairly good day today. Mom and dad may be home tomorrow night..... I'll probably be all around fayetteville tomorrow... we'll see.

Turns out that the cash office position isn't suitable for me. Oh well. There are other promotions I'm going to work on.

So here is what I did this morning.

Went to the bank, deposited my check. Went to old navy to get a new pair of jeans. Went to game stop, sold 18 games and got enough to pay very little for a game boy micro.

Went to Futon Mattress world and got a 11 layer mattress and cover (paid for by my parents).
Came home and cleaned the hell out of my room... now I'm just kicking it.
