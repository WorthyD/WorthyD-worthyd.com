More job opportunities that I probably should take. Part time cash office manager at Store #108 which is a lot closer to my house. I'm gonna go talk to the guy tomorrow morning.

I found a METROID ACTION FIGURE AT WORK TODAY!!!!! $5 for a six inch tall Samus action figure!!!!!!!!! Oh yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Fairly good day today. Mom and dad may be home tomorrow night..... I'll probably be all around fayetteville tomorrow... we'll see.
