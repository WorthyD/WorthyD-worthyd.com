So my computer desk is slowly starting to tilt to the right... I went looking for a new one. THis one hasn't made me happy in years... i've had it 6 years and it is really hard to move.... and it's broken in three places. Oh well. I'll pick one up in a month.

I almost drank a gallon of chocolate milk today at work. Work went well also.
