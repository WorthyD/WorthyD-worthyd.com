Work went well yesterday. I found out how really hard it is to order milk and get everything done. They have a guy helping me from time to time. I hate saying it but I need him... I hate the fact that I only like working alone. Oh well.

I woke up again at 2 am and couldn't sleep.

Leg still hurts a little. I hope it goes away soon. It's really annoying. I've had this leg injury for several years. Link below is what is wrong with it. Dang nerves.

I work until 11 tonight. WOOOOO!
