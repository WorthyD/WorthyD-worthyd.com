The grocery manager got transferred today. I'm not sure if this is a good thing. Yeah, he's strict because he's in the military, but he's generally a nice guy.

I'm going to go kick some chickens.... yeah... kick chickens... in Fable: The Lost Chapters... oh yeah.... The game that took 5 years to develop(began being made BEFORE the Xbox came out).. and i beat the original in 13 hours.... 8 of those hours were kicking chickens and punching down doors.
