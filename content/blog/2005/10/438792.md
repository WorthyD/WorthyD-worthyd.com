Don't get a Game Boy micro if you have big hands.... yeah.. I just tried to play some Zelda on mine... for the first time really and it was pretty uncomfortable... which is cool you know. I could play it... but I'd rather use my SP... however the SP screen isn't as bright as the micro... oh well. :) I'll put up with the small gameboy... so i can play it in my personal finance class ^_^
