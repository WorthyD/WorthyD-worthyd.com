Creating a schedule is more and more difficult by the semester. I'm trying to set up everything so that I can work close to full time at Harps, but most classes I need are right in the middle of tuesday and thursdays. I need as much of Tuesday and Thursday off so I can work load at harps. Grawr this kinda stinks. I'll figure it out when I'm out of class for the day.
