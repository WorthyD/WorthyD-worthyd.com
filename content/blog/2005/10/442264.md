I hurt all over. My body is so sore. My throat is swollen and hurting.

Starting next monday I'm going to be the new Frozen Dairy Manager at Harps on Weddington. This is a position I've been wanting for some time and I'm excited. I am hopefully going to get a raise after 90 days.

I'm going to buy a new desk tomorrow... I have to figure out how I'm going to re-arrange my room..... scurvey.....
