The extra 200,000 people in Fayetteville this weekend for Bikes Blues and Barbecue don't make me happy.

I went to best buy.... i go to the check out... there is a short, balding, grey haired man in front of me.... with a really ugly nose... I didn't think anything of it.

Going out to my car... I see a large SUV drive past me.... I turn around because the guy in front of me in line was driving it... it had the american flag razorback sticker on the back window.... I remembered who he was... and I honestly didn't give a crap... it's been almost 5 months since I encountered this guy.. and I didn't give a crap... I have enough going on in my life than to care about someone who punched me in the face in the middle of may.

This weather rocks. It's cold. I like it.

I hope I get my "promotion" soon. I'm tired of messing around with Customer Service. It stresses me out too much.

Don't get a Game Boy micro if you have big hands.... yeah.. I just tried to play some Zelda on mine... for the first time really and it was pretty uncomfortable... which is cool you know. I could play it... but I'd rather use my SP... however the SP screen isn't as bright as the micro... oh well. :) I'll put up with the small gameboy... so i can play it in my personal finance class ^\_^

It's official. Josh's and Mom and Dad's old computers are 100% dead. I'm thinking the boards are fried.... along with the power supplies... yeah smoke is a bad thing. :)

Starting next monday I'm going to be the new Frozen Dairy Manager at Harps on Weddington. This is a position I've been wanting for some time and I'm excited. I am hopefully going to get a raise after 90 days.

I'm going to buy a new desk tomorrow... I have to figure out how I'm going to re-arrange my room.....

Creating a schedule is more and more difficult by the semester. I'm trying to set up everything so that I can work close to full time at Harps, but most classes I need are right in the middle of tuesday and thursdays. I need as much of Tuesday and Thursday off so I can work load at harps. I'll figure it out when I'm out of class for the day.

Work went well yesterday. I found out how really hard it is to order milk and get everything done. They have a guy helping me from time to time. I hate saying it but I need him... I hate the fact that I only like working alone. Oh well.

Leg still hurts a little. I hope it goes away soon. It's really annoying. I've had this leg injury for several years. Link below is what is wrong with it. Dang nerves.

The grocery manager got transferred today. I'm not sure if this is a good thing. Yeah, he's strict because he's in the military, but he's generally a nice guy.

I'm going to go kick some chickens.... yeah... kick chickens... in Fable: The Lost Chapters... oh yeah.... The game that took 5 years to develop(began being made BEFORE the Xbox came out).. and i beat the original in 13 hours.... 8 of those hours were kicking chickens and punching down doors.
