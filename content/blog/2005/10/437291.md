I went to best buy.... i go to the check out... there is a short, balding, grey haired man in front of me.... with a really ugly nose... I didn't think anything of it.

Going out to my car... I see a large SUV drive past me.... I turn around because the guy in front of me in line was driving it... it had the american flag razorback sticker on the back window.... I remembered who he was... and I honestly didn't give a crap... it's been almost 5 months since I encountered this guy.. and I didn't give a crap... I have enough going on in my life than to care about someone who punched me in the face in the middle of may.
