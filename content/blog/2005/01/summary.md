I received my free halo 2 soundtrack in the mail yesterday. It's very excellent.

There is a nail in my tire........ no clue how it got there..... I don't even know how long its been there. I've been filling my tire twice a week... for a long time. I heard it bubbling since its been raining lately... kinda weird how I didn't notice it earlier...

## I'm so glad to be done house sitting - 2005-01-10 06:57:37

More events from yesterday.

Brandon pulled a leg muscle. So did I.

After our last game on the speed ball field we went and played some good old woods ball. We got tired of the obvious cheating of Impact and the Springfields complaining and All American Quiters bad language. I used my pump and let Jason use my autococker. It was so much fun.

I needed to leave early so I could take care of the dog. When I was packing up Kyle came up and told me he over heard one of the kid's dad from Oklahoma Impact telling him how to cheat with it being less obvious.

I'm gonna be kicking it at B&E; talking business crap with Ed most of the day.

## X....X.....X.... Looking for an X..... _looks down_... that _thinks_ is a plus sign..... - 2005-01-25 05:24:12

First night at the place went pretty well. I had to go out and purchase some breakfast consumables.

I litterally walked around the house for several hours (7:30 to 9 or so) just to get use to the place. It doesn't seem so bad when you walk around a bit. I transferred over stuff I had to have to live yesterday. Today I'm taking over the PS2 and maybe some other luxuries. Its a two bedroom place. I'm crashing in my church bud's room... the other bed room is pimped out... but I respect the guys privacy and probably will stay out of there. Plus his girlfriend comes by on a regular basis... i think... i don't know :-P. Philip I think has every single "official" star war novel out. He even has this kid's book series I READ when I was growing up. I peaked into the "Bounty Hunter" novel and read up what happens between Boba Fett and Han Solo thirty years after Boba supposedly died.

The night went well. I was occasionally awoken by a text message... but none of the calls woke me up I think I knocked out around 10:30 or so. The house makes a lot of noises. The heater/ac unit pops and rumbles a lot and there is a space heater in the kitchen and bathroom to prevent the pipes from freezing and those make quite a bit of sound.

Not a single window in the house has blinds or anything. Walking up to he place I can actually see through the living room, through the bathroom, through the little window in the shower into the neighbors yard. I used my fleece blanket to cover up the window so people driving can't see into my room err Philips room.

I woke up my normal time and just looked around a lot. I went outside to see if it was cold. It wasn't so I went ahead and drove to school. I was up in this lab by 6:45.

Wooo for all this fun stuff! :) It will be nice once i get the internet, but i'm in no hurry.
