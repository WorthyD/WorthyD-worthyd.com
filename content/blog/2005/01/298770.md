The final level was extremely difficult.

35 hour completion time. Not too shabby.

Downs:(Because everyone knows how I love to be negative)

- You get to level 20... and thats it. Becoming an all might God of the Jedi isn't possible.. or maybe I didn't play the game right which is a good possibility.
- There are half a million force powers and you can only get about 10 of them to use. Many are useless.
- You get 9 characters. I think I only used 3 of them because everyone levels up at the same rate.
- You're given all these stat options that seem pretty useless. Example: Security. The ability to pick locks. Any locked door can be bashed down. Demolitions: Most mines can easily be avoided.

Ups:

- Story - If you want to do a video game on star wars and want it to have a good story. Base it 2000 years before the movies and you'll have a master piece. I kept playing the game wanting to know what happens next. I loved it.
- Sound - Its a star wars game! Expect the best.

I haven't enjoyed a Star Wars game as much as this one. EVER!

Knights of the Old Republic II: Sith Lords would be next on my play list, but I must attack the pile full force before class assignments fully kick in.
