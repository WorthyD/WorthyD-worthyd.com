Just beat Pokemon Fire Red in 28 hours

Team
- Blastoise LVL 51
- Charizard LVL 47
- Venusaur LVL 45
- Dragonite LVL 56
- Kangaskhan LVL 49
- Gyarados LVL 56

Pokedex Seen 133
Own 50 (it was at 28 until I wanted to get the Exp All Item)

I was very impressed with how the game was remade. The graphics were smoothed out very well and the sound effects were actually bearable.

The game lacks a decent storyline which is pretty upsetting to me. The biggest draw back of the game is that you can never collect all 150 pokemon unless you own BOTH Green and Red cartridges.

#1 complaint Prima's strat guide sucks hard core! No accurate descriptions. They leave out several routes. They made it so that you can finish the game as fast as humanly possible and leave everything else out.

I really do love the game series despite its evil child following. YARG!!!!!
