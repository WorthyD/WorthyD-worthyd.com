Geeze. This game was fast.

Wonderful graphics, sound and control. Halo 2 is definitely superior to the first.

As expected the ending was most disappointing. It happened out of no where like all my friends said.

My theory is that the game was cut short because of the time schedule. I just have no earthly idea why they would stop the game right at the climax. The buildup was amazing. I actually wanted to play to continue the storyline. When I was playing as the Arbiter I wanted to know what was happening to the Master Chief and vice versa.

There should be more difference between the characters though. Such as noticeable speed and jump differences.

I loved hearing marines and grunts talk. The marines would talk all bad like "I blasted you foo!" then the Grunts were like "AHHH ITS THE DEMON RUNNNN!"

If there is no sequel i will be uspet. They ended in the freakin CLIMAX!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YARG! Still a good game though. I want to start playing multiplayer with some buds soon.

I'm off to play ORIGINAL MARIO!
