In Arkansas we have this awesome illegal drug called meth. This can be made with magical easy to find substances in your house.

One of these substances are match heads.

We limit people to no more than 2 boxes of matches. Each box contains a good 1000 matches. More than enough for your average pyro boyscout trip.

A very suspicious person walks up to my register with TEN BOXES! I told him that he could only purchase two and he replied that he would just come in later and get them. I shrugged him off. He told me it was his job to sell him them. Technically we can refuse selling stuff if we desire.

Three hours later I get another suspicious person with TWO Boxes of matches... three people later another suspicious person with two more boxes.

I mean, if the ONLY thing you buy are two boxes of matches people know you are up to something.

In other news I struggled to talk all day. I'm really not sure if its because I'm sick or if its because of talking at a high volume all weekend. I don't know, i'll probably be a lot better tomorrow.

_The Sound_ , a local news paper, did an article on paintball and my pics are plastered all over the pages. They are all the same pics I posted several weeks ago. http://photobucket.com/albums/v432/shadow_x/Paintball/ Most of the ones there.

Leaving to Kansas at 3 tomorrow.

I really need to get offline so I can do some home work.

## Kansas State University Tournament - 2005-03-13 11:45:52

You get no cuts today

**The Drive** Five guys in an s-10 blazer. How about that crap? Kyle, Ben, Brandon, Mike and myself.

**The Frat Party** We get to K.S. around 10 grab some food and go to a frat house. The guy who was in charge of the tournament was Phi Kappa Theta and he made arrangements so we could stay at the house. We all go and purchase our alcohol so we could sleep (not me). We get to the house "as the party was starting" and ... it wasn't very exciting. We sat and talked to this guy from K-State who was talking trash about how he's an Am player and plays three times a week. After a while he stumbles off and goes to sleep. We walk around and socialize. I met some Alpha Phi Omegas from K-state who were really really cool.. I walked around with a beer in hand (unopened) just to fit in. Kyle got a pic of me. According to Ben, our back guy who is a Lambda Chi Alpha, this party was like a normal night at a frat. By the time I get back to Brandon he has a new sophomore friend who wont leave him alone. She was kinda cute, but not my type. Brandon was EXCITED (extreme sarcasim). We talked to some Oklahoma guys who were talking like they were badasses. We kept telling everyone that we've only played together once... which was very true. They figured they would 0wn us. We watched super troopers for about 45 minutes then I went to bed.

One room.... 40 or 50 bunk beds.. yeah no privacy AT ALL! I went to a bed the head guy showed me to. He told me the guy wasn't here tonight.... and another guy told me he wasn't there that night... well around 2 in the morning someone wakes me up because i'm in their bed. Oh well.

We get up around 6 and head to the field at 8.

**The Games** http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v432/shadow_x/Field.jpg field image
Snake(2 foot tall LONG curvy bunker that was about 30 feet long) on the left side of the field(My side). Center 50 was the Xball X (about 25 feet tall, 20 feet wide, and 5 feet thick) Laid down so at a birds eye view it was an X. Right side(Kyle's and Ben's side) had a zipper(straight 2 feet tall, 60 feet long, bunker with knuckles that were 3 feet tall that you can use as cover. Misc bunkers all in the center and back part of the field. nice flat area on AWESOME grass. Five minute games. Games are usually over in 3 or 4 minutes. 13 teams showed. Every team played 8 games. At the begining of every game most teams huddle up and do like "1....2....3... TEAM!" or "1.... 2... 3.... KSTATE!" or whatever.... we did "1... 2.....3... DODGEBALL!" my idea!

**U of A vs. Iowa State** Went up to the chrono... my gun didn't work.... yeah THIS SUCKED...... I busted out Ed's dark timmy for the game and used my STO for the rest of the games. 5 balls a second compared to 18 with everyone elses!

These guys seemed pretty cool. They had several sponsorships so they didn't have to pay for most of the tournament. Really cool custome jerseys.
We broke out and lost one on the break. in about 2 minutes we were down 3 on 4(should have been 3, a player on Iowa had a hit on his pack that they were penalized for after the game) and I took off to blast a guy in the face... well I got shot in the balls. Iowa smoked the rest of out team. Losing your first game is tuff, but we weren't discouraged.

**U of A vs. K State Wild Cats Purple** These guys didn't look too intimidating, but we talked to them the night before since they were holding the tournament. No fancy jerseys or sponsorhips. Not much to say about this game. We broke out fast and took a lot of ground. I shot the two guys on my side of the field and Mike took off and smoked the rest of them. The game lasted about a minute and we had 4 bodies alive. This was the home team(they took 4th).

**U of A vs. O.K. CCC Snowflakes Red** These were some of the guys who were trash talking in the party. They claimed they rolled OK State in 30 seconds. We broke out and beat these guys in a minute thirty. They sent someone to our 50 snake on the break thinking they could make it. This guy took about 8 hits within the 6 seconds he was in the snake. Mike, Brandon, and I smoked this guy. 3 or 4 bodies alive at the end.

**U of A vs. Missouri** Missouri and Ok usually have good players, from what I experience, especially ones who cheat a lot. We broke out and I hit the 50 snake really really in the game. I played it cautious, the next thing I know the game was over. Kyle ran blasted the last two guys on a run through. We has 3 bodies alive at the end.

**U of A vs. LeTourneau University Turbulence** These guys were undefeated by the time we played them. They had head to toe custom jerseys and top of the line equipment. We watched them play and we knew we could beat them. They would send some one to my mirror and to the center 50. I had to blast center 50 and Mike was going to be on my mirror. The 50 guy never went to my side of the giant X so I crawled over and shot at my original mirror and got sloppy and he shot me. It took them 4:20 to beat us. 3 of those minutes we only had 2 guys and they ended the game with 4 live bodies. At the end of the day they took first.

**U of A vs. Southern Illinois University Salukis** We messed these guys up. It was awesome. Before the game I noticed one of their players was on AGD Lock and Load which is an AM psp team. They use mags.... Mags are the dumbest things ever.... this guy was even using a warp feed. I said we would get bonus points if we shot him in his dumb warp feed. At the beginning of the game they tried to send their #1 AGD L &L; player to the snake. We messed this guy up hard core. I shot him in the face AND his warp feed on the way in, but then he shot Brandon and Mike. THey should have pulled a penatly but the ref didn't see it. I started shooting at the center 50 X and the guys shooting out at me was shooting out of the left side of his bunker with his right hand. This made his profile enormous. Brandon was at the bunker behind me and he was laughing pretty hard. We finished them off in 45 seconds with 3 bodies alive. These guys DID NOT LIKE US AT ALL!

**U of A vs. O.K. CCC Snowflakes Blue** This was the only game we won where I was shot. I got out on the break and we messed up the rest of them though. Mike and I were the only guys dead. Kyle and Ben ran up the tape and shot everyone.

**U of A vs. University of Nebraska** This was our last game of the day. We needed to get like 2 points to get 4th place. Illinois told them what to do to beat us. We never changed game plans all day so it would have been easy for a team to beat us if they just had half a brain. We broke out normally. One of their guys took off to the flag. Kyle shot him like crazy before he got the flag. The guy kept running and jumped over the zipper on the other side of the field. On his run over there, Kyle, Brandon, and Ben had guns up rolling on the guys. He had to have had 30 breaks on him when he got up. They awarded him the points for the pull, which was bull crap. Kyle got out quickly after he roasted the guy. because he stepped out of his bunker to shoot the guy some more. Ben hit the zipper and crawled his way up. Brandon, Mike and I had eliminated 3 other guys by now. Brandon jumps over the zipper 3 feet in front of Ben..... We finished the game in under a minute. We earned Second Place.

**Awards Ceremony** We got our 2nd place trophy that was a good foot and a half tall. VERY AWESOME. Illinois was PISSED because they were third and we kicked their butts. Darran, the head guy, when accepting their 4th place trophy handed me the megaphone he had been talking into.... this was DUMB.... Kyle screamed YOU SHOULDN"T HAVE DONE THAT! and I turned on the siren part of it... then said "SAY CAR RAMROD!" into the megaphone. Iowa and LeTourneau started laughing their butts off because they knew I was quoting Super Troopers. It was awesome.

**Drive Home** Very long... didn't like it. Got home around 10:30

**Home** Went to the U of A to quickly check my email to make sure no emergencies had come up. Then called a buddy who was baby sitting. I then went home and cleaned up all of my equipment. They let us use a softball field as a staging area which was a BAD idea. EVERYTHING was covered in dust by the end of the day. I ripped apart my Green to Yellow EBLade to see what was wrong with it. I think the plunger had gotten messed up from the cold and shrank on me or something. ANYWAY ITS WORKING NOW YAY!

so yeah.. there is the experience ^\_^

I can pass a visual basic hand written no multiple choice test with an 80% no problem without the suggested 9 by 10 cheat sheet, but I can't pass an Organizational Behavior(business phsyc) test to save my life. Last time I got a 44 this time I got a 48. Boggles my mind. I take notes, I read the power points and the chapters and I can't even manage to get half the questions right in a multiple choice test. Why the hell am I in school?

On the way home from work last night I stopped by Game Stop and picked up Castlevania for my Game Boy Advance. G.S. is having a $15 sale on the classic nes GBA games. Since I worked about 5 or 6 extra hours this week I figured it couldn't hurt to pick it up. Next week I'll probably grab the original metriod also since I've been wanting to get that one for a while.... grawr.. FF: Dawn of Souls and Zelda Minish Cap are haunting me....

I've decided once I finish FFV I'm going to play my Lunar PSX games. I spent a lot of money on them and I haven't even played them.. yeah thats pretty dumb... so I'm going to play them....

## FFV completed - 2005-03-27 14:41:37

Final boss was a decent cake walk. Beat him with all 4 characters alive. FF6's final boss is a lot more difficult.

Over all, from what I remember the game was decent. I was satisfied. It would have been an excellent transition between 4 and 6 if I actually played them in order. It had a healthy mix from both games. Graphics, Sound, Features, etc

I actually kinda appreciate the job system now, but I still feel that there are a TON of pointless jobs in the game.

I think I'm going to attempt Lunar next, the only problem is that its at home and I wont be home for a week maybe. Oh well. I have a couple Game Boy games I could play.... or I could play FFX-2... yeah... not going ot happen.
