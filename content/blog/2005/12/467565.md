So I've finally seen a picture of Beast from X-Men three... it makes me CRAZY happy.

I sold my books today. 3 books for $117.00

I really wanted to buy Katamari Damacy at Best Buy today....but I was able to resist. Instead I got the Fantastic Four and a gift for my dad I really hope he likes it.

Amanda gets home Thursday. I am excited.
