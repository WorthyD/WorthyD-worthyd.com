Honestly... what am I doing in college?

I don't have the attention span to study or pay attention for half a class. I just took a test that I probably will get a D on. I want out of this gauntlet....

Speaking of gauntlet... I think I'm going to play it on my Namco Museum game when I get home... welcome brave warrior
