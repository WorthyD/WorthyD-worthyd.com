I'm done with Xanga. It sucks and I rarely get comments anymore so whatever.

Check out what my Fable character looks like.

Here is an official update:
Turns out my manager wont let me leave until after Thanksgiving. I call B.S. but I'll live. I'm only working 16 hours a week the last two weeks.

My old friend from highschool Amanda and I are going to try the distance relationship thing. She's moving back up here when she's done with school in six months. We're taking stuff slow so things don't get messed up.

Paintball... well I don't know... i haven't talked to any of the guys in what seems like weeks.

Sanity... gone a long time ago.

Not much of an update but it's late and i'm tired.
