Finished Fable Lost Chapters a couple days ago. Definitely worth 20 bucks. I took down the final final boss faster than I did the original final boss. Completed the game in 20 hours. I finished the original in 13. Word. I started a game in DQ VIII and I'll probably hit that hard in a couple weeks when I get finished with all my lame school work.
