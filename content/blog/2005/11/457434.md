I went to hastings to buy the Chronicles of Narnia.... I didn't find a good hardback copy of it. I did find the complete Lord of the Rings series in one book for $6.20. yeah Six twenty. It was used and in darn good condition. 1137 pages for six bucks. It rang up 21 bucks, but it had two price tags for 6.20 so they gave me the benefit of the doubt. I headed to Barnes and Noble for the Narnia book. I see it in the best selling paper backs, but I wanted hard back. So I checked the hard back. Picked up the DaVinci Code and then got Narnia.

I headed to Fiesta Square Harps afterwards. They told me what I would be doing when I transferred. They have $15000 in GMD merch in the back. Most stores only have 1000 in GMD merch in back at most. I get to beat the heck out of it until it gets smaller. I'm excited.

Work went well.

Amanda came up from Batesville to visit. Both of us had a rough week. She drove up and we were going to rent Charlie and the Chocolate factory, but of course Hastings didn't have it... instead... we went to best buy and I bought it.... in the process.... I picked up The Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, and The Never Ending Story.... They were really cheap and I've wanted them for a long time. I'm glad I had a good paycheck this week.

We watched Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and talked for several hours. It was great.
