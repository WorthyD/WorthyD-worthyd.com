I haven't gotten to play Fable in almost a week... over a week. Dragon Quest VIII comes out next week too... geeze... I have a feeling I'm going to try to cut my work hours so I have more time to relax, game, study, and read. Maybe next semester I'll be able to make better grades if I don't work so much. Yarg. Oh well. I'll get crap figured out.
