Practice went well. Clay from Torque tried to start a fight again. Lots of dumb drama. I tried to stay out of it this time.  Kyle and the King took care of most of it. It was rather funny. I'm way too high strung to let people like him get to me. I need to relax and get some home work done... I think I'll take some medicine and hop into the shower.
