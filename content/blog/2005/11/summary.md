Rough day at work. I ordered 77 dairy items and 40 frozen items for today... they shipped 165 and 80 respectively. Yeah. Wasn't too happy about that.

I'm closing off the weekend well though :)

I haven't gotten to play Fable in almost a week... over a week. Dragon Quest VIII comes out next week too... geeze... I have a feeling I'm going to try to cut my work hours so I have more time to relax, game, study, and read. Maybe next semester I'll be able to make better grades if I don't work so much. Yarg. Oh well. I'll get crap figured out.

## Daniel's adventure at the bordello! - 2005-11-08 15:04:07

So... I was playing Fable: The Lost Chapters for the first time in forever this morning.. I decided to go venture a path I had noticed during the trader guide quest. There was a new path in DarkWood Lake that I didn't remember from the last time I played the game and it wasn't in the original Fable guide. So... I decided to go down it. The look of DarkWood is pretty self explanatory. Dark Wood Lake really describes the area. Well I go down the path and... there is a door..... a door in the side of a mountain... TWF mate? Isn't it supposed to be like a cave entrance or something? This was a flat out REAL door that looked like it was to a mansion. I was like ok.

I go through the door and I came back into view in a cut scene where I'm being led to a mansion in the middle of a rather nice forest(not a marsh) by a lady probably in her mid 40s. Wearing clothing that isn't normal to the other Fable NPCs. When I checked the map I found out I was in the "Darkwood Bordello"... well I forgot what a bordello was until I made it to the mansion.

Yes my friends, one of the Lost Chapters of Fable is a whorehouse in the middle of a swamp... Yeah... so...I decided to mosey around the place and check out the area. Turns out the lady who escorted you to the mansion wants you to over throw the owner of the mansion.

There is also a Demon Door in the area. Perform tasks and the doors will open for you... this one in general wanted me to get laid 10 times. So... yeah... =I talked around the house... there are about six ladies in the house you can... mega uber extreme cuddle with.... really expensive one, exotic,, old lady, a rather "normal" girl and some other one I couldn't remember. The old lady was 50 gold and the expensive one was 2000... I spent the night with each girl once to see the different reactions... you don't see the sleeping.. but you hear rather humorous dialogue... especially the old woman.... so... to open the door i needed to hop in bed four more times.... i took the normal girl and skipped scene on the dialogue.

I head to the demon door... he opens.... and I get a PIMP HAT! OH YEAH A BIG ASS PURPLE PIMP HAT!!!!!! How awesome is that! I put on the hat and tried to set everyone on fire in the house, but my magic was disabled because there were no enemies in the area.... but I was able to fist fight!!!! Imagine a hero running around a whore house in his underwear(they take off all your armor when you go to bed) wearing a pimp hat PUNCHING EVERYONE IN THE FACE!!!!! I had fun... then I reset the game because I spent too much gold.

Car repair bill was large. I still saved around 500 bucks on it though. Would have been more, but you gotta pay your employees.... plus he gave us a tread mill.... I'm thankful that my dad is REALLY good friends with the owner of the place.

Leave it to me to try to tell my boss to transfer me the one day they aren't at work... yeah... looks like another week of pain and milk... oh well... it's just one week :)

I'm done with Xanga. It sucks and I rarely get comments anymore so whatever.

Check out what my Fable character looks like.

Here is an official update:
Turns out my manager wont let me leave until after Thanksgiving. I call B.S. but I'll live. I'm only working 16 hours a week the last two weeks.

My old friend from highschool Amanda and I are going to try the distance relationship thing. She's moving back up here when she's done with school in six months. We're taking stuff slow so things don't get messed up.

Paintball... well I don't know... i haven't talked to any of the guys in what seems like weeks.

Sanity... gone a long time ago.

Not much of an update but it's late and i'm tired.

I went to hastings to buy the Chronicles of Narnia.... I didn't find a good hardback copy of it. I did find the complete Lord of the Rings series in one book for $6.20. yeah Six twenty. It was used and in darn good condition. 1137 pages for six bucks. It rang up 21 bucks, but it had two price tags for 6.20 so they gave me the benefit of the doubt. I headed to Barnes and Noble for the Narnia book. I see it in the best selling paper backs, but I wanted hard back. So I checked the hard back. Picked up the DaVinci Code and then got Narnia.

I headed to Fiesta Square Harps afterwards. They told me what I would be doing when I transferred. They have $15000 in GMD merch in the back. Most stores only have 1000 in GMD merch in back at most. I get to beat the heck out of it until it gets smaller. I'm excited.

Work went well.

Amanda came up from Batesville to visit. Both of us had a rough week. She drove up and we were going to rent Charlie and the Chocolate factory, but of course Hastings didn't have it... instead... we went to best buy and I bought it.... in the process.... I picked up The Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, and The Never Ending Story.... They were really cheap and I've wanted them for a long time. I'm glad I had a good paycheck this week.

We watched Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and talked for several hours. It was great.

Practice went well. Clay from Torque tried to start a fight again. Lots of dumb drama. I tried to stay out of it this time. Kyle and the King took care of most of it. It was rather funny. I'm way too high strung to let people like him get to me. I need to relax and get some home work done... I think I'll take some medicine and hop into the shower.

Dragon Quest VIII ships today. I'm excited. I should be getting an automated call in the middle of my class tonight. I've been waiting for this game for a long time.

So apparently I belong to the "Black Shirt Mafia" of paintball because our team jerseys are long sleeve black t-shirts. A bunch of guys from Iowa had said they dubbed us the "Black Shirt Mafia" at the Illinois event. I guess the name stuck and a bunch of people in the NCPA have started calling us that.

If I were a university bus driver and it was Halloween, I would be Blinkin from Robin Hood Men In Tights. I would totally mess with the people on the bus.

Finished Fable Lost Chapters a couple days ago. Definitely worth 20 bucks. I took down the final final boss faster than I did the original final boss. Completed the game in 20 hours. I finished the original in 13. Word. I started a game in DQ VIII and I'll probably hit that hard in a couple weeks when I get finished with all my lame school work.
