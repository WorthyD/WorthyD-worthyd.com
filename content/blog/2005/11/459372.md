So apparently I belong to the "Black Shirt Mafia" of paintball because our team jerseys are long sleeve black t-shirts. A bunch of guys from Iowa had said they dubbed us the "Black Shirt Mafia" at the Illinois event. I guess the name stuck and a bunch of people in the NCPA have started calling us that.
