I lost it today at the tournament. I volunteered to help out and ref.

Last game of the day, I was reffing and talking to Kyle who was on the other side of the net. Jon was next to him and Kemp was jumping around like usual. A player on the field who is on Kemp and Jon's team takes off to the snake. Kemp screams COME ON KENT! Scary Gary then accuses Kemp of side line coaching. I calmly told him that I heard what Kemp said and it didn't do anything to the game at all. Gary called me a liar then said there were three guys pointing and side line coaching. This is when I blew up. I yelled at him again, ripped off my goggles and threw them a good distance. Scary Gary was over 50 feet away. Jon wouldn't do something stupid that would dock his team points. Kemp gets overly excited and I know for a fact Kyle didn't give a rat's ass about the game. Stuff like that just drives me crazy. Gary will go out of his way to screw Justice League over. Jon and I predicted it before the tournament and it happened. Thankfully no points were taken away and Justice League Kids won the tournament. I'm not even on JL, but that was just bull crap. those guys have busted their butts to get where they are.

## Daniel messed up Hard Core - 2005-05-21 16:57:07

On the way home I'm going 75 in a 70. Out of no where there is a guy tailing me. Guy looked to be 60 or so with his wife in the car. Speeds past me. I was pretty pissed. I was passing people in the right lane, I was going 75. So I was upset. Guy passes me and flipped me off, I flipped him off (Mistake #1). He gets off on the same exit as me. We stop at the stop light at 40th and Elm Springs. I see him look at me in the rear view mirror. I smiled and waved (big ass mistake #2). The guy gets out of his car. My window was rolled down.

Man: You got something to say to me?
Me; I was going 75 in a 70 whats your problem?
Man: Can't you see the fucking sign on the side of the road? It says slower traffic stay right.
Me: I was passing people going 75
Man: It doesn't fucking matter! You better check your self before you flip me the bird again, you can just ask my parol officer.

I was about to roll my window and just take off, but by the time I looked back at him he punch/slapped me in the face. I couldn't tell. It knocked my glasses off. I opened my door and checked the ground to see if my glasses were knocked into the floor of the back seat. I looked up and he's peeling off. I get into my turning lane and the lady in the van next to me is screaming asking if I'm ok. I gave her the OK sign and drove off.

I'm thankful he didn't kill me. I wasn't in the right anymore than him. I learned my lesson.

So an employee got arrested today! I was all checking and stuff. See the District Manager come in with a couple Police officers.

15 minutes later one of the pharmacy guys comes in. I've never had good vibes off him. BAM they slap the hand cuffs on him and escort him out. I was like "WHOA!" Turns out he had been stealing for a couple months, they just couldn't pin any evidence on him.

Loretta later told me to quit "poking around and be more of a leader". The ultimate way to piss me off is to tell me I'm not doing my job when I am. Matt and I were busting our tails to get load done, but we kept getting called to check.

Drs appointment in a little over an hour. I have these little white dots in the back of my throat. Thankfully, the Dr who scared the hell out of me(pp and skin cancer) in 8th grade retired and my new dr seems really cool..... then again its been 2 years since i've seen him. My throat is just so sore and I'm tired of it all

The casting for X-Men 3 is looking good. Colossus, Angel, Beast, Juggernaut, and possibly Gambit are making appearances. I is very excited about this :)

Harry Potter 4 is due out in november, but i wouldn't be surprised if it gets pushed back.

Tons of other movie just is exciting me right now
