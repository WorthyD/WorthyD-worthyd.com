I just completed Metroid Zero Mission. Game time 3 hours 31 minutes. The game was a BLAST. This game is a lot of fun. Especially since I had just played the original Metroid last week.

Sound was phenomenal! Every song from the original was remade and less annoying than the first. Kraid's music gave me goose bumps

Graphics were very colorful and gorgeous.

Controls were a LOT better. The ability to shoot diagonally makes a HUGE difference in the game. The ability to crouch was also very nice.

The new weapons and abilities are VERY VERY nifty. There is a ledge grab so if you slightly miss a jump you grab onto the ledge and pull yourself up. I'm a bottomless pit LOSER! Morphball jump was cool. Super Missiles were killer (especially on Mother Brain and the final boss).

The end of the game had a VERY interesting twist to it which basically was an added level that helped tell the story of Samus.

The special features of the game are great. There are difficulty settings. I finished no problem under Normal. Upon completion of the game you can play the Classic Metroid and view picture galleries.

This sets the standards for how games should be remade in my opinion. If they remade the original Zelda like they remade this game I would cry with joy.
