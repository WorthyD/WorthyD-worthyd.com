I've been fortunate enough to be able to start working on several AngularJS applications and I can honestly say I haven't had more fun geeking out on a project.  They are internal projects so I can't really show them off and brag about them, but I am really happy with my work.  It's not perfect, but I feel like they are pretty good for the first few runs.

On this last project, I hit a really big snag on performance.  I was working on a grid with inline editing that required specifically formatted inputs.  I cannot deny I'm an Angular rookie, but I really wasn't sure where I should start with debugging the issue. 

I stumbled on [AngularJS Batarang](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/angularjs-batarang/ighdmehidhipcmcojjgiloacoafjmpfk?hl=en) while looking at a couple of Chrome extensions.  Long story short, this is exactly what I've been looking for and more.  Check out this video that shows the features.



Checkout this extension if you are new to Angular or are looking to optimize your Angular app.  It's really easy to use and extremely helpful.
