Iï»¿'m trying hard to not focus 100% of my time on Destiny 2.  I've had a good mental reset by playing other games. Particularly, games that stress me out a lot less. A few seasons ago, I tackled the Shattered Throne dungeon solo.  It was hard and I didn't really enjoy myself.  It was a great accomplishment, but I don't know if it was worth the anxiety involved.

I've decided to put just as much effort in my Steam backlog as I have Destiny 2. Here are a few games I've recently checked off my backlog.

## [Bioshock Remastered](https://store.steampowered.com/app/409710/BioShock_Remastered/)

 Bioshock was one of the first games I 100%ed on the xBox360 in 2010. I have a ton of fond memories of playing it. My wife was really interested in the story and characters.

 The remaster holds up.  I didn't experience any glitches or crashes. I don't think the game mechanics will be very enjoyable for people that didn't play it back in the day.  I mainly played it for nostalgia and the newly added achievements. It was enjoyable. I don't know if I'll revisit Bioshock 2 Remastered.  I liked the first one more.

## [A Short Hike](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1055540/A_Short_Hike/)

 This game is great.  You play the role of a bird and you explore an island. You help out characters throughout your journey to the top of the island.  It's a very frustrating free journey and a lot of fun play. The only frustrating part of the game was a beach ball mini game that took about 20 minutes for me to complete. Small potatoes compared to the 4 hours I spent on a solo Destiny 2 dungeon.

## [Fable Anniversary](https://store.steampowered.com/app/288470/Fable_Anniversary/)

Another game that I have fond memories of.  I was never exposed to the original Fable marketing.  I got a job at Game Stop shortly after it was released and remember it getting traded in a lot.  I bought an xBox shortly after starting the job and got the original Fable game not knowing anything about it.

I really enjoy the Fable universe. I had a lot of fun playing Fable 2 and 3. Fable Anniversary was a good nostalgia trip.  I don't expect they will do a Fable 2 or 3 rerelease, but it would be nice.  I hope the reboot of the franchise goes well.

## [Haven Park](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1549550/Haven_Park/)

Haven Park is an amazing gem.  I got it with a coupon from buying the Humble Whimsy & Wonder bundle. I 100%ed it in about 5 hours, but it was a lot of fun. It feels like Animal Crossing with fetch quests. I highly recommend the game for anyone looking for a chill and fun game.

I'm trying to keep a cycle of chill and then hard/revisit game.  I'm currently working on Quake. It was remastered last year without the need to repurchase the game.  I have another farming sim game on deck after that.  Destiny 2 is always an active game for me, but it not going to be a top priority for me.  It took me a long time to mentally adjust to this. I'm in a better place for it.

I'll be posting up my short reviews of my games as I complete them. Hit me up if you have any questions on them!
