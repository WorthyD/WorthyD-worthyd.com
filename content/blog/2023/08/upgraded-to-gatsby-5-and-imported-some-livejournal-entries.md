I﻿'ve mostly ignored this codebase over the last year due to other priorities. I feel like Twitter is a dumpster fire and would like a better method of expressing some of my more curated thoughts.  This codebase was pretty out of date and Gatsby has been bumped up a version since then.

T﻿his project's code base is based off of <https://vagr9k.github.io/gatsby-advanced-starter/>  I really like functionality of the project, but didn't like how stuff was abstracted.  I started with a plain TypeScript Gatsby V5 project and moved everything over.  It was a pretty tedious task and was pretty frustrating at times. I did learn some of the inner workings of Gatsby though.

I also went through about 2000 of my LiveJournal posts, deleted a bunch of the cheesy ones, and wrote a node script to combine them by month.  Enjoy some almost 20 year old blog posts.
