I love getting to build cool stuff, but my buddy has taken it to an absolute  new level.  My fellow technology architect [Warner Skoch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/warner-skoch-b718492a) (aka "Wermy") has blasted himself into geek immortality by cramming a Pi Zero into an Altoids Can AND a full sized Game Boy.  Every thing I've ever built looks like a pile of dog poo with glitter on it compared to these sweet Raspberry Pi Zero builds.





I managed to make it to Stage 6 - Energy Zone in Contra on the GameBoy.  The build is very sturdy.
