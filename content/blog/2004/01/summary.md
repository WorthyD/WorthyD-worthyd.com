## Stupidity Runs Rampant - 2004-01-04 04:29:46

All yesterday I was pulling up steaks and hammering thme back into the ground. It sucked my hands are mangled. The Brass Eagle All Stars showed up to practice. They're the only NPPL Pro team in the state. They took second place in the last tournement. So technically they are the second best team in the world. Their playing style shows they shouldn't be messed with. Well they showed up so i had to postpone re doing the field. They left around 4:00 giving me less than 2 hours of light to do a 5 hour job. This royally sucked. I didn't get the field exactly how i wanted it, but it was a different design from what it was. You can't have a tournement field the same or some team will play on it so much they'll have a total advantage on it. So who gets to redesign it every time? ME! By myself! It sucks. Well I have to get ready to ref my bum off all day. Maybe I'll be alive still at 5.

## The Adventure Comes To An End. Sword of Mana - 2004-01-04 18:29:03

I completed Sword of Mana today. Five minutes ago actually. Shadow's(the hero) and Silver's (the heroine) quest came to an end. I beat the living piss out of Julius. I was LVL 61 with 29 hours and probably 30 minutes. It was at 29:02 at the last save point. Ending was very sad, I almost cried I enjoyed the game too much. Like I did with Secret of Mana. I don't want to put the game down. I want to go on more adventures in the world and never stop playing it. I know in my heart that it can't be like that. I must grunt and move on and visit another fantasy world that I may enjoy and experience.......... Now the question remains.... what game is next?

Well I finally ordered my mother board and CPU stuff. I'm hoping it gets here soon. I paid a massive shipping cost for it. I think I'm going to make the massive best buy run the day after I get it, which is hopefully thursday, but with my luck friday. Oh well, its all good. I watched Kenshin and .hack/sign last night. Kenshin was really cool. .Hack was odd, but its because I know NOTHING about the series. I recognized ALL the music though. Thanks to Silvermane who sent them all to me a couple months ago. It was really cool. It was like listening to the original soundtrack to star wars for months and then going to go see it after a couple more months :-D It was awesome. I got to talk to Amanda until about 11:15. It was nice talking to some one after my little experience earlier that I blew out of proportion. Stupid highschool girls form the city of the Wal-Mart head quarters! I'm gonna go ahead and warn everyone that there may be a time soon when I'm not on the internet for a while. If that happens, that means that I'm having trouble reinstalling the stupid wireless internet crap. I should be fine though.

The above was for the morning but my journal wouldn't let me post because of stuff. Nothing big happened today at work. Church was good as usual. I talked to the head of product development at Brass Eagle about their new products and industry standards on stuff. So yeah.....

## Ahhhhhh - 2004-01-24 05:19:50

Well I spent all afternoon reconfiguring the new comp. One BIG problem that kinda kept me up for a while was the fact that my new computer fan is LOUD. There are three options for it. A.Regular which the fan runs full speed 24/7. B. Adjustable where you have a little knob to adjust it. and C. Temperature control where you have to put a sensor between the heat sink and fan and that controls the speed of the fan. I REALLY want to use the temp control, but I can't get the fan off the board. I have it set up on adjustable and i'm afraid I'm going to leave the fan too low and its going to destroy the processor and MB. I don't know where to find the temp of the processor besides the BIOS which I can't get to unless the computer is booting. HEY! If anyone knows where I could get my hands on some Torrent download files for ANY RPG/Anime soundtrack PLEASE let me know. I have a couple torrents going at the moment including .Hack! In other news, I slapped my old Intel Celeron Processor sticker onto my paintball gun. I'm the only guy on my team not using an electronic gun so people give me crap. Well my gun is now Pentiumized! Ummm I'm getting my hair cut in an hour. T

## Boredom - 2004-01-26 06:12:25

I'm sitting in the 112 lab.The 112 lab rules. Its on the bottom floor of the Walton College of Business. No one knows about it and they have the fastest computers on campus. 2.46 Ghz to be exact. I just printed offa 44 page Lunar 2 faq. It was originally 100 something. I butchered the hell out of the margins and changed the fonts. I have two more FAQs i plan on printing off before I leave the lab. one's 31 pages and the other is 60. I don't think I'll do the sixty just yet. I'm gonna see what happens. I may print it off wednesday. Ok never mind the lab instructor just left. I only have 29 more pages ;). That will be printed off in about uhhh 5 minutes which is basically by the end of this post. DONE! :) Last night I watched 12 Kingdoms Vol 2 and I watched vol 3 again. I looooooove the series. Silver told me the 4th volume is coming out tomorrow. I hope Best Buy gets it :)It'd be cool! Gotta get to class now :-P

## This blows - 2004-01-28 06:13:00

I can't access my comp account! Well my FTP comp account. So I can't get my game FAQs for the day. Maybe I'll try later. I had a couple episodes yesterday. It was fun now that I think about it. I applied for a bunch of online personal adds. Man I'm a weirdo :) I also decide I'm going to start going to Bible studies with my Dad on Tuesday nights now. Hopefully I'll meet some people. I've been looking up new parts for my new paintball gun I'm about to build. This is the last thing I need to do. Freakin spend more money. UGH! So yeah I'm gonna get crackin on that FTP thing now. There's gotta be a way.....
