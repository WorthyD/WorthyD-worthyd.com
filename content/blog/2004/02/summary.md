## Too tired to type.... - 2004-02-01 16:26:06

Today went pretty well. DiRt came out and practiced. It was really nice getting to see all the guys. I use to play for their Jr team the Dirt Kidz. I left the team because I was always worrying about money and stuff. I haven't really gotten to play in about 2 or 3 months. Palmer told me he's ready for me to start playing again. Coming from him I was pretty surprised. He's always been kind of a jerk to me, but I guess maybe its because he wants me to get good or something. I told Ed I'd start playing again as soon as it got a little warmer and I get over my injury. I told him I'd be playing the back line though. He told me that I'm too dangerous to be in the back. That made me feel really good also. At the end of the day after the last game everyone was hanging around a starting bunker talking about what stuff they were going to do next. I hear "HEY WORTHY!". It was Ed and his gun was pointed right at me. He shouted "Dodge it!". He shoots, I dodged it. He was 30 yards away so I had maybe 3/4 of a second or a second to think and move. Well after two shots from Ed I have Heck, Andy, Palmer, Grebb, and Bill also pointing their guns at me. Each one would shoot and I'd try to dodge them. Grebb and Bill I don't think hit me. Which I was REALLY surprised about. Heck decided to try to f\*ck up my leg and was shooting at my legs and feet. Palmer was aiming at my head. He hit me probably twice out of ten shots. Andy shot my shoulder. It was hard to figure out who was actually shooting at me. Heck and Palmer actually shot at the same time a couple times and i can't believe I was able to dodge both. This really isn't that big of a deal. Its actually a practice drill we'd run all the time. The only difference is that there is usually only one gun at you. I had five in a group of 8 or 9 guys and it was kinda hard to tell who was going to shoot.

I'm not going to watch the super bowl at all. I'm watching errr playing THE ZELDA BOWL!

## AHHHHHHH!!!!! - 2004-02-14 05:12:34

Ok I tried to play Majora's Mask last night. IT AINT GONNA WORK! The game drove me insane! I think I'm going to try and play Lunar instead. I'm so much in Link mode rightnow though. I don't really want to play Wind Waker again and Zelda 2 is pretty hard. I think I'll play .Hack//Infection. Oh yeah, happy valentine's day or whatever.

## Super BORED! - 2004-02-16 17:00:39

Ok I'm bored so I decided to write a top ten RPG/Adventure games in my library.
I could play any of these games ALL day long from begining to end without stopping I love them so much.

1st : Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past
First Adventure game I ever played on the good ol SNES. Very first game that EVER touched me emotionally. I've ripped this game apart like none other. My church had this game donated and I played through until the Dark World within an hour and a half. It scared my youth director. This game has the graphics are my favorite and the music freaking rules. I built models of this place with my LEGOs all the time back in the day.

2nd : Chrono Trigger
I've played one game file for at least 150 hours. I maxed out ALL of my characters to level 99. I love the story and the music. My first impression of the game when I saw it in Nintendo Power was "The main character looks too much like the Boy in Secret of Mana. This game is going to SUCK" I rented it and fell in love. I bought it for 70 new and sold it and bought it back for 54. I currently own a CD and a Cartridge version of the game. I'm patiently waiting for a true sequel.

3rd: Secret of Mana
Beautiful graphics and an awesome sound track. I tried SOOOO hard to break the limits of this game. I tried landing Flammie into areas that didn't exist. I loved the game so much I wanted to know everything and find everything. I found all of the weapon orbs in the mana fortress and leveled up ALL of my magic to level 8:99. The game was just too much fun for me. I got into the game quickly after Link to the Past and shortly before FFIII

4th: Final Fantasy III(VI)
When I saw this game I screamed. I rented it and was like DUDE! Well I wasn't talking like that back in 94 or 95, but still. I played II(VI) and loved it. The game has the absolute best story line of ANY game I've ever played. I played the crap out of this game. On my cartridge I have all lores, all magic on all characters, and 75% of Gau's Rages. This game is not as fun as all the others. You don't really get to see a lot of cartoonish characters like in Secret of Mana. Only Moogles, no mushbooms, dwarves or anything cute and cuddly. But Moogles do rule. I own a cartridge version and a CD version

5th : Super Mario RPG
There isn't anything you could possibly hate about this game. It has a unique graphic system and totally weird story line. It's the Kingdom Hearts of the SNES. You have cameo appearances left and right. There isn't anything I didn't like about this game.

6th: Earthbound
A truly unique game. Its impossible to describe this game without having the reader play it. It is the ONLY rural based RPG I know of that is worth a darn. You walk around in towns, help out the ghetto blues brothers, help out Mr Saturn, and have a party member named Poo. The game is fun!!!! The few draw backs are that A the characters walk really slowly and B there IS a point of no return. I HATE points of no return on games.

7th: Kingdom Hearts
I use to hate Disney. This game touched me. The story was wonderful. The graphics are exactly what I want in a 3-D game. Gah, if all 3-D games had the same graphics I would be SOOOOOOO Happy. Tons of side quests. The fun factor was GREAT. A truely FUN game.

8th: Sword of Mana
Great game. Great story line. The simple fact you can play as boy or girl through the game gives it an AWESOME replay value. To fully understand the story you have to play through as both. It had a lot of qualities that Secret of Mana had that made it such a good game.

9th: Final Fantasy VII
This was the game that drew most of the people into the Final Fantasy series. I enjoyed the battle and magic system. The graphics were ok, could have been more colorful. Vincent kicked BUTT. Good story.

10th: Secret of Evermore
I know most people would never touch this game, but I loved it. The game play alone was what made me love it. It was Secret of Mana with different characters and a different story. The magic system was pretty cool. Music was cool. I just enjoyed the game a lot for some strange reason.

Couple Runners up. They just had a few too many small things that aggregated the crap out of me.
Zelda Wind Waker
Chrono Cross
Final Fantasy IV
Final Fantasy IX
Final Fantasy X

This is Bill. The one I mentioned earlier. See how busy he is? He gets paid top dollar to do that. He's suppose to be fixing loaders, but everyone at the even was sporting a different type.

Well I've found my next game. I put in a bunch of games into the PS2 and game cube and the only one that really caught my attention was .hack//infection. Just way to many features on it that I like. I made some GHETTO pasta this morning. It was fun :) I need to get to work.
