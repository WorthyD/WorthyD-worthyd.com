## A real update! - 2004-11-01 06:38:07

When I got to work at B&E; I purchased 2700 dollars worth of paintball equipment for fairly cheap. I know who's owned all the stuff and what condition its in. I wont comment on how much I bought the stuff because I"m going to sell some of it and I do want to make a bit of profit on it of course.

Friday night my dad's friend Cheryl had a cookout for me. I had an AWESOME STEAK. Around 9:30 or so Staci called me and asked me to bring over my shoes I was going to wear with my costume. I told everyone I was taking off... and they brought out a cake.

I head home and get a belt... but no boots. I felt stupid when I showed up at Staci's. I wasn't feeling well at all. I had a sore throat and stuff nose with sinus pressure. I just assumed it was a sinus infection that I always have around this time of the year.

Some lady Saturday told me that we would have more customers if we would lower our prices on stuff at the paintball store. We sell at MAP and we'd lose our dealer license if we sold any lower.

Saturday night I talked to my girl on the phone and Ed and I went around to several stores to get stuff for the store and for the tournament. We got home late and watched Bowling For Columbine which was kinda good. I fell asleep in the middle of it.

Tournament went over well. My U of A/G.Z boys got second place. I'm really tired. But I still want to go hang out with my friends.

I just had a nice long update destroyed because of COBOL.

I was grumbling at COBOL because I couldn't figure out a counter problem. Amazing how much stress can be caused because of not having a period in the right place or a number being a couple digits off.

I'm sore all over today. The tournament really took its tole on me. I shot Jason's Dark Timmy. It was just like mine.... I wish I hadn't sold mine now LOL. I'll probably buy another one this summer.

I'm going to take out a hefty student loan this month for next semester. I'll throw a bunch of it into savings and see what little interest I can earn on it.

Halo 2 releases tonight. I'm scared. I get to go into work at 10pm and leave at 2 pm. I have class at 8 am the next day. W00T! This should be fun.

I have a test today EEK!

Halo 2 release went well. Only had 1 or 2 arguers. Besides that it was kinda fun. Saw Nate, Kyle, Brandon, Matt, and Joel. Bunch of old friends of mine. It was fun. I'm really really tired.

Here are some more details of all the fun I had last night!

They make all the employees walk around outside and talk to customers. No biggy it was actually kind of fun. We had about 200 at our doors. EBGames around teh corner had 10 i think.

It got really cold so I put on my Zelda jacket. I had about 10 people tell me its the coolest jacket ever.

Gotta talk to my friends in line.

When we opened up everything went smoothly for the first 100 games or so. While everyone was outside we handed them their VIP reciept which was their actual customer copy. They'd bring it in. We'd X it and hand them a copy. EASY easy easy.

By the time the line started to dwindle down people didn't have VIP tickets so we had to look them up and that really slowed down the process. This is where people got irritated. We tried. I heard some guy say "We've had it paid off since February" and another group only had two receipts but claimed they fully paid for three games.

By 12:45 everything had died pretty hard. We had a full box of trade-ins that I labeled and put out.

Cheryl (the only girl that works at G.S.) and I were the VIP hander outers and so by the end of the night we were just goofing off. She kicked my arm (she's very athletic) and I went "Owwww FIRE 3!!!!...... its not working" she started laughing pretty hard. She was later grumbling about how hard its going to be to get her boyfriend off single player mode.

ALl the employees were on a sugar rush. It was a lot of fun.

And..... right before I left at 1:50 I was shuffling through our used PSX game bin and found a game I wanted that was 100% unopened but still "used"

On the night of the LARGEST video game release EVER The Halo 2 release party.... I bought.....

**Resident Evil 3: Nemisis for Playstation** for $9.50

Who is the Olde School Hero?

When I got home from class I played a bit of paper mario. The game is so much fun.

I talked to . Such a wonderful person to talk to. I'm trying to get her the .hack OST because her Evil X destroyed her copy. Its an awesome OST.

I then watched the first Volume of .hack//sign and napped. I have 6 DVDs and 4 games(basically one giant game) of the .hack series. I don't think any game series has ever captured my attention so quickly. I know I can get top dollar at game stop for the games. Heck two of them i can trade in for a free copy of Knights of the Old Replublic 2(along with an aditional two games from a long list of popular games). The anime story is good. The anime music is phenomenal. The characters are realistic. The game play is awesome. Much like Kingdom Hearts. It is a pain because you seem like you are doing the same thing over and over. But the overall story is just awesome. There isn't anything I don't like about the series. I wish they would extend it to an Everquest style MMORPG or something. Grah!

I just finished chapter 4 of Paper Mario. 17 hours of game play so far. It took me 15 to finish Fable. I'm satisfied. After every chapter you play a quick even as Princess Peach and Bowser. Several times as Boswer you get to play through level of the original Super Mario bro's and go at it Godzilla style. Its really funny.

I need to finish getting ready for work.

## I have an idea! - 2004-11-11 15:52:25

Advertizement at Game Stop:

Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II!
FREE!!!!
WITH TRADE-IN OF 4 Of These games!

Then is a list of games that we give from 10 to 15 bucks for anyway. You get 20 bucks for Fable. 25 Bucks for Star Ocean: Til the end of time. 15 bucks for FF Chrystal Chronicles.

They do have some rare old games that are on there like Dark Cloud 2 and some of the .hack games (the second and fourth odd enough).

Its a full list of New or Rare games. A couple I actually want to pick up. Like Suikoden III.

I LOVE the idea, but say I trade in Fable, X-Men Legends, Morrowind and Halo 1. ALl are on the list. Fable and X-Men gets you $40 bucks! morrowind gets about 7 or 8 and Halo gets you 12. Thats about 60 bucks in Store Credit. The game only costs $50. So it kinda sucks..... oh well..... I'll probably find a way to get it. I don't want the game yet, but its always good to know that I could trade in 4 of my games to get a really cool new one.

Spent the whole morning watching videos on IGN.com. Here's what I've found

- 1\. Katamari Dumacey looks like a kicking game. Minus its disturbing intro music.
- 2\. Golden Eye Rouge Agent is something I want to pick up but I can't afford.
- 3\. Gregg Hasting's Tournament Paintball is going to be better than I expected. It comes out next week and I have it reserved paid in full.
- 4\. The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap is a lot like A Link To The Past graphics and a little higher sound wise. I hope I can afford it when I come out.
- 5\. Final Fantasy XII looks too much like Final Fantasy X for my taste. I truely think my taste for the series has ended.
- 6\. Zelda BS looked cool, but its BS.

I'd like to note that I hate AIM express because I sign on. 30 minutes later I get a message asking to reconnect. I reconnect. And three people I wanted to talk to are online and AWAY. How long have they been online? 20 minutes. Idle about 10. AHHH! GRAWR!

## I GOT A GRUNTY! - 2004-11-15 18:11:47

I goofed a lot today at work.

We're running a new deal where you get 30% more store credit on games and I thought we were running and older deal where you get 10 bucks for three nonsport games. Well the new thing applies to ALL games and I didn't know. Mistake 1

I accidentally forgot to get some one to sign their credit card receipt. Mistake 2

It was a really busy day.

I went to the mall and picked up some Dot//Hack toys. I got a stuffed grunty (seen below) for 7 bucks normally 20. Two action figures both for 2.99. its awesome!

OH! I LEARNED THAT MYSPACE.COM SPONSORS THE NATIONAL PROFESSIONAL PAINTBALL LEAGUE! HOW COOL IS THAT!

Went to GZ and got a lot more money than I thought I would. I need to go deposited it tomorrow.

I helped little Eric with his new gun. Watched Justice League and Team Hooker practice.

The field sold some equipment of mine so I had to wait for Jimmy's wife to come pay me for it. After I was paid it started down pouring.

I left and got ahead of all the rain. It should be hitting springdale in a couple minutes.

Josh is home tonight so I think i'm going to spend quality time with him if no one wants to go hang out.

## 2004-11-21 19:13:17 - 2004-11-21 19:13:17

Josh and I played Halo for a good hour or so. I was planning on going to bed an hour ago.

I really enjoy playing video games with my brother. We never get to spend time together since he moved out. If I do move in with him it will be absolute hell ^\_^. Halo 2 will be EVIL!

I almost one match. I'm not good at video games.....

There I said it... I suck at video games.

I like RPGs because I can level up like CRAZY and then beat the heck out of bad guys.

Side scrollers? I'm terrible. I can't beat resident evil without a walk through.

## 2004-11-23 07:04:00 - 2004-11-23 07:04:00

Grammy and Grandpa have a $400 dollar flat screen TV.... they don't have cable. THey have antenna or however you spell it.... how wrong is that?

Dad told me several times to "smile". I really don't like it when people tell me to smile. I'll smile if I want to.

## 2004-11-25 08:08:02 - 2004-11-25 08:08:02

So my brother is engaged now..... yeah

Josh, Alex, Leah, and I played Halo 2 for a couple hours. I made little contact with the family. Dad was playing my Ron White DVD and Blue Collar Comedy tour DVD to entertain the rest of the family. I'd say we had 10 to 15 people here.

Kristin died last year on thanksgiving. I was expecting this to be a hard day, but it turned out better than I expected.

I beat Halo 1 a couple hours ago. Fun game. I'll probably pick up Halo 2 around christmas.

Hard core work day tomorrow. It should be fun. and I were going to go out for dinner after I get off work, but she said she may not be in town. Oh well. Its ok.

I'm house sitting until sunday so I may not be online much. Give me a call. Need my # send me a request via aim.

Cobol Teacher:You can manipulate variables in the middle of your if statements much like I can with these lights
_turns lights off_
Cobol Teacher: See?
_turns light switch on.... but the lights don't turn on_

Oh my Cobol class is a hoot.

We are running a buy two get one free on used games at game stop. I'm tempted to buy another n64 and controllers and all that fun crap. Maybe some game cube games.... AHHHHH! NO EVIL CAN"T NO!

I get to take out to lunch today. W00T!
