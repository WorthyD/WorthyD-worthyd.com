I got the virus/spyware crap off my computer. Pretty annoying crap.

I played Dark Cloud for a bit. My weapon levels are so low I'm amazed I made it this far into the game.

Punisher comes out tuesday along with Eddie Murphy's "Raw". Gah I don't need to spend money, but that is some good stuff thats too good to give up.

I finished Dark Cloud this morning. I started Dark Cloud 2. Its even more like Kingdom Hearts than the original Dark Cloud. In the middle of a dungeon floor, Dad came in and started talking to me. He watched me complete a couple levels. He said there would be no way for him to ever be able to play one of the new fangle video games. He did think it was cool since he witness cut scenes where it goes into the characters past he said "This is really neat!" and I replied "why do you think i've been playing them for 15 years"

COBOL programing is so much fun. Its so utterly pointless. Our teacher gave us an assignment that everyone got done in five minutes but me. Why couldn't I get it done? Because every computer I tried to open the COBOL editor on blew up. AND the program source code can't print on the regular Black and White printers so we have to send them to the color printer which requires the lab operator to come and activate the file to print. I got up to ask the lab lady to activate it, but she was on her way out of the lab to do tech work in the other lab. Gah, yeah this was totally fun. I winged it and beat the system which I usually always have to do.

I just ordered Resident Evil 0 for Game Cube for 20 bucks and Resident Evil Code Veronica X for $12 used.

This happened when I watched the first movie. I went out and borrowed Resident Evil and beat it on PS1. I eventually ordered it for Game Cube just for kicks and giggles.

Capcom.com doesn't have any new copies of RE2 or RE3. Hastings in Fayetteville has a new and used copy of RE3. New one is $40 and the used is $30. I'm not going to spend that much on one of those.

I already own RE2 for PSX thanks to the five dollar sale at Circuit City, but I'm a spoiled brat and I want the updated RE2 for GB that has better voice acting and better graphics(and loading time hopefully).

## Its a fun day in the computer lab - 2004-09-28 05:23:47

My third COBOL assignment is due today! YAY! As far as I know its 100% correct. COBOL is more difficult that I expected. Not hard just very strict in its formatting logic stuffy things.

The new Flogging Molly CD rocks. I love it. I listened to it at B&E; Paintball (aka work) yesterday. Three of the guys there hated it.... well that was everyone who was there. They said it was crap. Ed loved it, but he had left. I got my taste in music from listening to his stuff constantly.

Pokemon game is really cool. I got my first pokemon and stumbled around a bit. I'm going to probably buy the pocket trainer's guide.

I've had no real time to freaking play games lately. I've been hanging out with friends too much. Its by no means a bad thing. I guess I'm just going to take my Game Cube to B&E; and leave it there.
