## Leave it to me to break rules in Hot Topic - 2004-07-05 12:24:46

I stumble around in Hot Topic trying to find a new Nintendo shirt. I don't NEED any more shirts, but I want a GOOD Mario shirt. My only one is white and is small. NOTHING! Oh well. I broke down and walked over.... jumped... and grabbed a Nintendo Messenger bag and walked up to the register and apparently I was suppose to ask for help with it.... :-P...... three seconds later the manager guy or whatever is tickling the living crap out of the girl who checked me out. It was pretty funny. I think the girl is an LJ user... I'm pretty sure she is actually. I dropped her a comment. If its the wrong one I'm going to feel soooo stupid :-D

I went to best buy next, but doesn't work there anymore so I only stayed like five minutes. I then went to toys r us next and looked at new toys. They have transformers that are 30 freakin bucks and they are just the cars and small things. I think they are metal though. Ninja turtles are around 7 bucks a piece now! I remember when I was a kid they were like 4 bucks! When I walked in this guy said, but not screamed at the top of his lungs "Hiiiiiiii!!!!" just like Dave Chappelle when he did the Great New York Boobs skit. When I left he said "Byeeeeeee have a good day mann!!!" I then go to Barnes and Nobles and picked up a java script book and here I am. I'm gonna take a nap and watch a movie.

## Stick it to the man and drain that can! - 2004-07-10 17:07:37

Fairly good day at the store. Did a lot of business. The air we ordered was on the back dock when I got there. Which is cool I have a feeling a couple may be empty though. They were pretty light. We did 250 bucks more than we did the day before. Most of it was CO2.

called me on the way home. I was SOOO excited. She asked me my opinion on Kingdom Hearts.

## ATTENTION FELLOW GAMERS! - 2004-07-10 19:31:34

I need some opinions guys. I've bought a hell of a lot of games and I need to play them. I'm really.... really REALLY picky at the moment. I need a FUN RPG I have an idea what I want, but I'd like some more opinions. Normally I'd say suggest ones that i could BUY but I don't need to buy any more right now. I really really need opinions. These games are either new or collecting dust for a LONG LONG TIME

PS2
- Dark Cloud (the Intro seemed kinda boring)
- Okage Shadow King(i'm thinking i'll start with this one)
- Summoner
- Eternal Ring
- Drakan: The Ancient Gates (i can't find much info on this game, but the info makes it look fairly cool, I NEED OPINIONS!!!!!!)
- Xenosaga (the intro kinda bored me so I didn't get far)

PSX
- Lunar(followed by Lunar 2)(I've seen it played and it looked difficult)
- Arc the Lad (i know nothing about)
- Suikoden (i don't want to start unless i get all the other suikoden games)
- Breath of Fire III (i haven't enjoyed any of the other ones)
- Threads of Fate (looks colorful/fun, but I haven't heard much about it)
- Tales of Destiny
- The Legend of Dragoon (I remember the commercials were good, but besides that I got nothing)

GBA
- Golden Sun (I played 3/4 of it before and if i remember correctly it plays really slow\_

I had a customer chew me out today. He had called asking if he could return a marker package he had purchased thursday. He claimed I talked to him and I never remember the guy. I told him we had a 20% restocking fee. We calculated it out and all that stuff. He spent 200 on it be would have kept 160. I called Ed later to confirm what I did was correct. Turns out we don't do that anymore. We do store credit returns which is basically the same thing in theory. Ed also brought it to my attention that on the bottom of the receipts it says "All Sales Final". Which makes sense. We aren't Wal-Mart. We can't just send back stuff to the suppliers and expect credit back. He comes in and I inform him of it. He was cool with it and leaves. He then called me an hour later saying "some one did paper work for him". I told him it was me and I had called the owner and he said we didn't do that anymore. In the past we had done that and we had just recently changed the policy. I apologized for the misinforming him and he starts chewing me out saying that my manager should have informed me of this and blah blah blah. In the two years of existence of B&E; in Fayetteville I can only think of ONE time a marker was returned and he traded for a better gun.

After work Ed showed up and we went to the mall and talked to Daniel Hot Topic. I found some sweet new nintendo jackets. I'll probably picko one up after I get a new job.

I'm tired as hell. I've been on my feet all day. I'm going crash on some Okage.....
