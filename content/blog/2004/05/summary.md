I wrote out 775 dollars worth of checks today... on paintball stuff...... 600 on my dark timmy and 175 to fix my brother's Angel.

I hate this weather. Its hot and nasty.... I miss my a/c in my car....

I keep realizing how much music I lost when I switched my computers and when I wiped it clean last month. I lost about 4 gigs worth when I switched computers and maybe 2 last month when I cleared my hard drive and started over..... I should have known better.... there is no legal way for me to get them back either :(

Devil's Den is JACKED UP! My eagle project is still intact. However Lee Creek has found a new route. It looks like a hurricane blasted through the pace. BIG trees knocked over. The 60 foot suspension bridge is GONE. No sign left of it but two big concrete stairs. All the play ground equipment is jacked up. I mean wow. I was just speechless when I saw it. Its really sad. I had a lot of fond memories of the creek and the dam/waterfall that is now just chillin. The dam is now a wall. No real water for it to hold back. It really really really really sucks. I wish I could have gotten pictures....

## E3 has already been promising. - 2004-05-12 11:02:57

The new Zelda games are already looking sweet. I can't wait for the GBA one. The cube one (which i'm going to make a user pic out of) looks alright, but isn't up to my satisfaction. I'm a fan of a cartoonish Link. I loved Wind Waker because of Link's facial reactions. The Link in the movies and pictures seems to have a blank face mainly.

The new sony system the PSP looks kinda cool. The FFVII prequel is suppose to be on it. The dual screen nintendo hand held doesn't look special. I can't wait until the end of this! I WANT TO SEE IT ALL!

www.gamefaqs.com is doing one of their best games ever polls. Everything is going as I had hoped. I'm really hoping a Zelda or FF game wins. That would RULE if Zelda: Link to the past won. A 16-bit game kicking the poop out of 128 bit games in polls :-D However I think the polls have been bias since most people who visit the site are most likely RPG fans. HALO was beaten by Starcraft. I'm not sure if this is Starcraft as in the PC game I use to play or some other game thats ripping off the name. Halo is suppose to be the sh*t. I'm surprised about Earthbound being beaten by Doom and the Starcraft thing, but Super Mario RPG beat street fighter two. SF II was an extremely popular game in the arcade. I wish they'd post the numbers of votes so I could see how close they were. http://www.gamefaqs.com/poll/spr04_bracket.html

I read the whole first book of the Harry Potter series today at work. It was about 8 hours worth of reading. No biggy. Nothing else eventful. I'm really tired.

## Book number three coming right up - 2004-05-19 09:59:37

I just finished Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. I wasn't so tempted to rush through this one like I did the first one. I knew I couldn't finish this one in one day so I cut it in 3/4s the first day and the last 1/4 today. Its an excellent books. I kinda feel dumb I've waited this long to read it. I'm tempted to go and purchase the LEGO models now LOL which I was afraid was going to happen.

is hopefully going to come and visit friday night. Ohhh I can't wait. I haven't seen her in a long long time.

Odd things have been occurring lately. I've had the urge to purchase a Pokemon game. I FORCED myself to play Kingdom Hearts last night. I have this gut feeling I'm not going to meet and it hurts. Finally, I'm actually reading.....

I'm done with Kingdom Hearts for a while I guess. I'm working B&E; today. Should be fun. I also should be getting my Dark Timmy today which is freaking sweet. I get to write a 6000 dollar C.O.D. also :)
