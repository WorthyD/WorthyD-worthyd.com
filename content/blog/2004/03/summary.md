Today was lovely. 3000 dollar day at the field. Average around this time on the year is maybe 1000. If we're lucky. I had a to take care of the "semi experienced" player. Which basically means the dicks. I had 4 kids that were just jerks. One guy who thought he knew everything and was VERY rude and loud. 6 to 12 kids that were ok, and finally one kick who yelled at me, telling me I wasn't doing my job. He told me I wasn't reffing just standing there. Sorry, but when there are 20+ idiots on a field shooting at each other I can't watch every single one. I just blew him off the rest of the day. I was pooped at the end of the day and some of the guys asked me to play. I shot some guys up. It was fun. I'm pretty sore now. My hand was bleeding earlier. It stopped and I can't tell I was even shot now. I love paintball. I don't know what I'd do without it. I can't wait to get my new gun running. My parents are out of town tonight and no one's in town. I guess I"m going to chill and eat my Skittles.

Well here's a better run down of yesterday. I'm not tired so It should go well
The tournament was a breeze. Six teams showed and they shot the crap out of each other. At the end of the tournament everyone wanted to play one BIG game. I was like COOL! When you get hit go back in. So it was a big endless game. After two minutes I grabbed a friends gun and took off and dove over a bunker and realized his gun was jamed. While I was fixing it a fat kid shot me in the foot. No biggy I went back to the base and started playing again. I took of and just ran down the tape line blasting. The whole team decided to shoot me. I counted about six breaks on my chest. One on the hip and numerous on my mask and gun. It was a Fight Club moment. Normally I would have stopped and walked off the field, but I kept running. I didn't care about anything. Getting shot like hell was almost enlightening or however you spell it. All the teams received prizes and everyone had a good time.

Ben and Joel (the owners) had to leave early. The tournament ended two or three hours early and we still had rec players at the field. Pure rednecks. We have a sign on our back door in four inch RED letters "Wild World Staff Only" and in two in black letters "Please stay out of the building and off the ramp". On a blue grey door it is EASY to read. These guys were coming in and out like crazy. One guy told me he use to play a loooong time ago. He said he had a 2000 dollar gun. I'm sorry but its hard for me to believe a guy who has no teeth and no hair about when he's babbling about owning a 2000 dollar gun before electronic guns were out. He may have ment 200 dollar gun, but thousand came out. That would be more believable. Then he told me he "shot a kid through a swiming pool and split him from there to there". I didn't see where "from there to there" was but I've never seen a paintball wound "split" I've seen bruises and welts all the time but no "splits". I have no clue how he could shoot through a swimming pool either.

I got home extremely tired and stuff. I changed at the field so I wouldn't have to change at home. If my parents saw the bruises on my chest they would freak out. They hate paintball. They don't think its safe. I took a shower and plopped down and talked to , and a crazy girl on Yahoo. My head really started hurting so I took some advil and lied down for a while. I tried to make an LJ entry but Amanda called. She's on her way back from Boston. I haven't gotten to hear her voice in a LONG time. It was nice to hear from her period. After I got off the phone was online and we talked about .hack and she sent me some 12 Kingdom music. She went to bed and I decided to also.
