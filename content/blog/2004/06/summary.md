I picked up my GBA SP yesterday. Its cool nothing special but the color.

My Spyder finally sold at the paintball store the other day. I got an extra 100 bucks in my pocket yesterday so I went to Best Buy and talked to for what seemed to be the better part of an hour. I enjoyed it.

My boss at the paintball field called and asked if I could work this afternoon. I asked my aunt if it was alright and she told me that if i wanted to quit it was alright. I tried to explain to her that I didn't want to do that. I really would rather work her than there. I need the money though :( I've thought about quitting the paintball field..... I've thought about it really hard..... I think I'm going to..... I just need to talk it over with Joel :-/

## And he's not quiet dead - 2004-06-15 23:48:56

Ok So I went down to the good ol Fort Smith Arkansas today to skate with Ed and the B&E; guys. My leg's been acting up again so I kept telling them I shouldn't....... well one guy had a spare board and I couldn't help myself. I skated around until I lost control and ran into a door and FUNKED up my leg. I chill for another 15 minutes then skated on the carpeted room, just to get my ballance down. I was getting pretty good if you ask me :) They have a 2 1/2 foot ramp half pipe thingy. They told me I had to try it..... I did and I fell! Thankfully Brooks let me wear his pads. I would have been fine if my leg wasn't bad. I was on the floor maybe two minutes because of my leg. I was laughing my butt off literally. I'd laugh and flex a lower back muscle that would hurt like a chinese whore.

Other news:
I've taken up HTML again. I think I'm going to start learning JavaScript soon.

I've gone into Mole Paranoid mode. I was at the store(B&E;) the other day and noticed a weird looking mole that wasn't the same shade as it use to be. I'm COVERED in moles(genetic) and its hard to keep up with them all. I have all sorts of weird looking ones that would normally be considered bad, but they aren't black. I'm always paranoid because I can't remember if ones have grown or not. Too much skin cancer in my life to NOT be paranoid over it.

I played THIS

For about two hours at work.

MORE GOOD NEWS:
I'm happy and hyper at the moment. I want to get a skate board SOON! :) I'm going to schedule a DRs appointment if my leg doesn't feel better soon.
