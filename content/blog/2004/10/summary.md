I picked up a Game Stop application today. The manager said hiring was going to be done differently for this christmas. He said after christmas they would keep whoever was the "best employees" so i have a chance of actually keeping a job. He also said that I'd get between 10 and 15 hours a week normally but during christmas it would be a lot more. I'm going to do it.

I just finished Fable.... 15 hours...... um.. thats just not right for an RPG.... some one told me that it could easily be finished in 10 hours. The ending stunk.... so far....the game would have been a lot better if it was longer.... i'm ... disappointed in it.

OK so I've read everywhere you get a plus game at the end of Fable. I didn't get it. Oh well..

I started Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door a bit after completing Fable. Hopefully that game will be fun. It should be. I"m loving the graphics so far.

My allergies have calmed down.

The Paintball Budget is done.

Tomorrow will be the end of most of the stress (hopefully)
