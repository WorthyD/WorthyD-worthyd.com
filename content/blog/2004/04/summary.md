## They call me E.L.F.! - 2004-04-20 14:19:06

I just spend an hour playing with a paper shredder...... and i wasn't shredding papers. There is a door where you take out the shredded paper. The shredder does not operate when the door is open. I spent all that time trying to learn how the sensor works. I figured it was a switch on the upper side of the door. NOPE. then I thought it was the magnet that keeps the door shut. NEGATIVE! Turns out there is a hidden magnet in the door that activates a switch. If i place three paper clips on it properly it will shut of the signal and the sensor thinks the door is open even when it is shut. I don't have a strong enough magnet to do the reverse effects. Now my 10 year old cousin is trying to raid my food stash.

I went to B&E; as usual after a fun day of work. Ed told me the price of the Dark Timmy's went up from 1100 to 1150. It sucks because Warped Sportz didn't even want to increase the price. It could be worse.

My leg injury from last year is coming back in full force. I could barely walk to my review session for Geology Lab on time. I think I'll do well on the test. I walked out the building with a girl who's in my lab class. We talked a tiny bit. When we went different directions she said "Bye"

I think I'm going to gimp to bed and go to sleepy sleepy

An Autococker($400) paintball marker was stolen from B&E; around 6 or 6:30. The gun needed an air source, loader, hose, and ASA to work properly. Two suspicious guys came into the store today. Ed was in the back, but saw them come in. He mouthed to me to watch them. They bought a CO2 tank, hopper and paint. Ed told me to make sure that I get an ID when I sell them the stuff. One left while i was filling the CO2. The one who paid had no ID. Ed told me they were in the store when the gun was stolen. They came back in about 10 minutes later. They purchased hose and an ASA I got the ID and got all the information. They drove by in their crappy car and we got the license plate number. They stopped in the front of the store and came in to get screws. They never mentioned what type of gun they had and claimed they were talking to the guy on the phone who needed the stuff.x I'm not profiling or anything, but any idiot woudl be able to tell that it was them who stole the gun.

I spent 2 or 3 hours reading about the Residen Evil series. Basically going over the whole storyline of any of the games worth playing. Just like any game that is drawn out too far it tends to suck the farther it goes. I quit reading the overviews after RE:3 which was about the 2 hour mark i think. I skimmed the rest and read over the movie to game comparison. I'm usually not big into horror games or movies, but the Resident Evil series seems interesting.
