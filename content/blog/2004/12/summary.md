Ok here's a better update for last night.

Work was good. We did 1200 bucks in business which hasn't happened in a looooong time while i've worked. I took out at least 100 pounds of card board to the dumpster. I had a 6000 dollar PMI order that I had to price in the morning and there were half a million boxes that came with it and the orders from the rest of the week.

Nobody came in and visited me today at the store. The paintball kids usually always come in for a couple hours.

After work I went to game stop and stared at games for several hours. We still have 25% off on everything but new systems so I felt like I had to get a new carrying case for my game boy or whatever. I stood around and talked to the staff forever. I picked up Metroid Fusion and a new game carrying case.

Then I went to the dollar store with Heather to pick up food. She told me about a local Anime shop that was in the square. I sprinted over to it. VERY VERY small store and limited stock on stuff. They had a lot of wall scrolls that I want. I looked at some stuff to get prices to compare to online. Their prices are what is "retail" on the web. Its a locally owned store so I don't mind. The girl wrote out my receipt and hit the no sale button..... I do the same at B&E; ^\_^ I KNOW WHAT THEY ARE UP TO!

We then went back to Heather's and we talked for a while. Marshall, Laura and David eventually came over. I watched some Red Vs Blue while they were on their way and heather was cooking. When she was done cooking we watched the Boondock Saints... I fell asleep and missed the amazing speech at the end. So yeah.

I'm going up to ground zero today. I can't find any good breakfast :(

I just got back my huge COBOL project that I was stressing about before thanksgiving break. I got a 42 out of 50 which is absolute crap. She took off a lot of points because of formatting. The header of a column of my output was one space to the left than the information. I really don't think thats worth taking points off. The program worked. I got all the information properly outputted. The format shouldn't be worth so much. She also took off points because I didn't have a grade sheet when I know for a fact you had to have a grade sheet since it was a group project. I remember writing my partners grade 10 minutes before turning it in. ARGH!

Anyway, my grade is at a 73.85 at the moment. A s on all programs and D s on all tests. Which should be worth more points? Writing it on paper? Or Coding it first hand? Apparently the teacher thinks on paper..... I know Tyson and JB Hunt don't make you code on paper.

I get to work today.... yay! I'm going to head home afterwards and play knights of the old republic. I really think I'm going to need the guide. I don't think I should buy it though. I'll head to Barnes and Nobles since i get a 30% discount there and see if they have it before work.

## I feel like a complete jackass now ^\_^ - 2004-12-07 16:19:25

I boot up the game Pokemon Fire red...... I notice the previous owner had put..... 295 hours on this cartridge.... I looked around at the pokemon he had put on teh game. He had a bunch from Ruby and sapphire. At least 30 pokemon at level 50. Now what sucks about this is that I couldn't trade the ones from Ruby and sapphire over. What sucks even more is that there is level control in the game. A level 50 pokemon wont listen to an inexperienced trainer. I traded for an unused Eevee, Gyrados, and Dratini. ALl worth getting. there is only one eevee in each game. Gyrados is hard to evolve up to since its previous creater literally has no attacks. Dratini is so hard to find that i would scream and cry about trying to find it back in the day.

Here's my party so far
Squirtle LVL 9
Charmander LVL 5
Bulbasaur LVL 6
Gyrados LVL 24
Dratini LVL 18
Eevee LVL 25

I don't think Eevee or Gyrados will pay attention to me until I get a couple badges but that wont be too bad. I'll probably replace Eevee with a pikachu or something and I'll have a set team for my game.

I erased a kids 295 hour game..... on a game checkout... well one this is that whoever gets the cart will have a LVL 60 charizard and a lvl3 rattata... so yeah ^\_^

Playing in a warm up 2 on 2 game. That was my baby gun. It broke on me shortly after that game. I spend 5 hours teching it this morning. There is no more blue on it. Oh and I do shoot better left handed than right. Note "Shadow X" and the triforce on the tank.

I blasted Jimmy's Kid in the face in a one on one game after talking trash.

Customer at Game Stop got angry because he purchased some cheap memory cards claiming you couldn't save any games to them because the blocks were so small. They were 59 block mem cards. He purchased the sims with it. The sims requires like 80 blocks or something. Maybe one should read the labels before you buy.

Customer at B&E; picked up a gun that was broken and a while later the kids mom called and claimed they didn't pick it up. Two hours later they called and said they picked it up.

Today:
Went to Best Buy and spoiled myself.

At B&E; I had to go stock up office supplies at Office Depot. I then went to wal-mart where people go into horn wars over parking spots. I hate it.

Went to best buy and picked up a new fridge for the store. On the way back to the store I almost rear ended some one. I checked the lane to my right, I look forward and the cars in front of me were in a dead stop. I braked and swirved out of the way. I could have seriously hurt some one.

I then went to Siloam to help Jimmy set up his web page. I'm going to clean up my room and get busy on the web page. I leave you with this. A pic of me sporting my new Empire gear.

I went crazy on the XBox training the past couple days. I ordered the Halo2 Soundtrack, halo2 tshirt, Xbox ear warmers, Fable, and Sudeki. For about 25 bucks. What would that be retail? Around 110 bucks.
