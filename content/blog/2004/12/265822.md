Just beat Paper Mario 2 The Thousand Year Door. It was alright. Final boss wasn't as hard as Smithy in Super Mario RPG, but it was definitely a fun game.

The game really wasn't much of a challenge. I don't recall ever dieing. The final boss was long but fairly easy.

Graphics are amazing. I love how the characters are designed. The bright colors are what I desire in RPGs now a day

The level up system kinda sucked. You couldn't actually level up your attack or defense. You could only level up your partners twice.

Out of 7 partners I only used 3 on a regular basis, the others I only used to get past certain events which were required. Koops and Gombella were acquired early in the game and I didn't get to use them as much as I wanted to since their attacks became extremely weak when I got Yoshi and Vivian.

I spent 40 hours on the game which is average for me since I couldn't really level up a whole bunch.

Badge system was cool. You get like 100 badges but I only used about 10. Many seemed pointless.

The game is definitely worth checking out. Good comic relief in it. Lots of "bling bling".
