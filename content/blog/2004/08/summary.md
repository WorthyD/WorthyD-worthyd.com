Drove to Fort Smith Arkansas this morning. On the way I made an attempt to pay at the pump with my Driver's Lisence. My credit card is usually my third card deep in my wallet. NOT THIS TIME!

Went too far.

Went about 100 feet into Oklahoma

I didn't lock the back door at B&E; the other night but everything is ok and Ed isn't mad at me.

I hung out with Courtney all morning who is the B&E; girl.

I helped paint part of the wall..... I started with a big fat "Dan Rules" on the side and eventually painted over it.

Painting Blue on white sucks!

Brooks played with his girlfriends kid. It was amazing seeing him act... so loving. I've never seen him like it before.

Courtney left and Andy came in. We kicked it for another 5 hours.

We went to skate.

I worked on my drooping in and all that fun stuff.

I taught myself how to ollie (jump the board) and broke a window in the process.

I offered to pay for the window but Brooks didn't care. I think they are planning on destroying the warehouse soon so I lucked out.

Went home early.

Drove 150 miles today.

Completed the first town of Dark Cloud. Tons of fun. I'm highly enjoying.

Secret Window is MESSED UP. Very creepy, but could have been a lot better.

Watched Ocean's Eleven afterwards. Very good. Enjoyed it.

Good times

## I'm the guy in black - 2004-08-15 18:42:42

I went out to Ground Zero this afternoon and played all day. I got to play with a church group. I got to play with J-Man's kids too. It was really fun. I didn't shoot the crap out of anyone. Everyone called me the guy in black.

At the end of the day they did a "Take all you can game" where you were out when you couldn't take anymore. Then you'd go back to the base and get back in until you run out of air. It only took 5 shots to the top of my head to get me to give. I ran around to the other's team's base. Started shooting at some one, looked up and i had three guns on me from a catwalk. Yeah, it was cool.

I gave J-Man's kids some paint so they could play longer. They're good kids.

Josh is officially moved out. I think this house is going to suck now... maybe... hopefully not, but yeah. Its going to be different.

## Third - 2004-08-22 14:52:14

We took third. Came home with 130 dollars worth of prizes. Eight teams showed up. We were in first most of the way, but stuff happens. The teams that beat us deserved to beat us. We lost three out of 9 games. In the finals we were tied for third, but smoked the the team tied with us. It was awesome. I should have some pictures soon. I'm extremely tired.

1st Place Team Virus (national X-ball team from Springfield)
Prizes 2004 ProStock Autocockers($400)
2nd Place Justice League (These guys are VERY cool. They are around my age.)
Prizes $100 gift certificates to Luis and Clark and sire paintball shirts
3rd Ground Zero Extreme (Me)
Prizes Evolution II loaders, sweat bands, and T-shirts

More Edit:
Our kill count was cool "Your momma!!!!" was we killed one guy "Your momma's momma!" was we killed two and "Your momma's momma's momma!" was all three were dead.
I also screamed "GET OUT DONKEY!" all day. Those made the people on the side lines laugh all day. It was great.
Plus after games I did "The Baby Bird" I'd flap and bounce around it was cool. That made people laugh too! I hope to get videoes!

## Ugh - 2004-08-24 18:42:43

My COBOL class has seven people in it. One is a 35 year old who I worked with at Tyson. A guy I was in boyscouts with is also in there.

My ISYS 3333 class is going to be boring. I know three people in class and I'm not too close to any of them. Class is going to be boring.

I went to buy my books 420 bucks. For 5 books. I about cried. It sucks pretty bad.

I've been playing classic Zelda on my GBA SP. I'm starting to get more theories on my Zelda time line. I'm afraid its going to be totally different. :( Ugh
