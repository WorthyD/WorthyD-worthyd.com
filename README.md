# WorthyD's Gatsby Advanced Starter

A starter skeleton with advanced features for [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/).

It is based off of [https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-advanced-starter](https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-advanced-starter) by Ruben Harutyunyan ([@Vagr9K](https://twitter.com/Vagr9K))


I've upgraded it to the latest version of Gatsby and removed some of the customizations that I didn't need.
