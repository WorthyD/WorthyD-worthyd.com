	<h2>AboutMe</h2>
	<img src="/content/images/me_animetar.jpg" class="aboutMePhoto" />
	<p>I'm a web developer out of Northwest Arkansas. I presently work for Rockfish Interactive and have been with them for almost
		three years. I consider myself very blessed and fortunate to be working for this company. </p>
	<p>I graduated from Springdale Highschool in 2002 and graduated from the University of Arkansas in 2007 with a Degree in Small
		Business Management. Shortly after I graduated college I married my best friend from highschool. She graduated from Lyon
		College with a degree in Biology. I'm a big nerd/dork/geek. I collect action figures, play with LEGOs, play retro and new
		video games, read the Lord of the Rings, and would participate in renaissance festivals if I had the time. I've come to
		embrace this lifestyle recently due to the fact I was trying to "fit in" all through highschool and college. </p>
	<p>I'm a member of the First United Methodist Church in Springdale, AR. I've been going to this church my entire life and it
		really feels like home to me. I went through Boy Scouts there and earned the rank of Eagle. I value this more than my college
		degree. Anybody can go back to college and earn a degree, but not everybody can put forth the hard work and dedication to
		earn this rank before the age of eighteen.</p>
	<p>I consider myself an avid gamer. I got my first system, the NES, when I was in first grade. I played the heck out of Zelda,
		Mario and Mega Man games. I was placed into Resource Reading in third grade. My parents bought me the Legend of Zelda: A
		Link To The Past and playing this game boosted my reading level to fifth grade. I eventually found a love for RPGs. Chrono
		Trigger, Secret of Mana/Evermore, Earthbound and Illusion of Gaia were a few of the games I would spend many hours playing.
		Fifteen years later I'm playing Wii and Xbox360 with my wife. Currently playing a lot of Bioshock and Halo games. Both series
		have very interesting storylines. Halo has an excellent book series that expands the universe and explains a lot of cool
		side stories and characters. </p>
