Today was kinda weird. In my philosophy class a student asked the teacher if she believed in God or not. The class was dead silent. She said she changed her mind all the time. After class I went to the grocery store on the way to B&E; Paintball to hang out with my buddy Ed!

I went to work and worked for a while. Ben, my boss at the paintball field called me and told me about the Orracle he ordered for me. Its costing me $550!!! Its normally a $1000 gun! I was so excited. I'm waiting for the Joe Schmo show on Spike TV to show. Its a really funny show.
