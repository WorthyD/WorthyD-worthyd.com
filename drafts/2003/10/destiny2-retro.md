## WorthyD's Destiny 2 'Season 1' Retrospective

### Pre Destiny 2 Experience

I came into D2 with much less xp than the standard destiny player. I was an avid PC gamer and liked the concept of Destiny, but wanted to wait until it was on PC before playing it. I had acquired a PS4 around the time they announced D2 and picked up D1. I played through all the story content of all the expansions by the time D2 rolled around. I came into Destiny 2 with roughly 100 hours over 6 months of Destiny experience.

### Destiny 2 Story

The overall story was interesting. Our character gets all their powers stripped and we start from scratch. It was a decent way to hit the reset button and set a level playing field for new and old players. This was a pretty big gut punch to returning Destiny 1 players. There was just enough content for someone like me, but it was a real big grind to do for all 3 of your characters.

### Destiny 2 - Leviathan Raid

I had always heard about how much fun Raids were on Destiny podcasts. I managed to get together with some local friends to do the raid. It took us six hours over two nights to complete. It was rough. We had some hard negative attitudes from friends of friends. After, we finished the raid, they were done with the game because they had hit 305. The max level.

The raid was a lot of fun. I liked it changes the order of encounters every week. They year 2 weapons. Slot changes and meta updates made this raid a lot easier in the future. I ended up getting ## clears before it got vaulted.

What I liked
I really enjoyed the initial D2 offering. I put in roughly 10 hours into the game a week and never really got bored.
